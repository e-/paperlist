        "authors": "I. Scott MacKenzie",
        "abstract": "The human eye, with the assistance of an eye tracking apparatus, may serve as an input controller to a computer system. Much like point-select operations with a mouse, the eye can \"look-select\", and thereby activate items such as buttons, icons, links, or text. Applications for accessible computing are particularly enticing, since the manual ability of disabled users is often lacking or limited. Whether for the able-bodied or the disabled, computer control systems using the eye as an input \"device\" present numerous research challenges. These involve accommodating the innate characteristics of the eye, such as movement by saccades, jitter and drift in eye position, the absence of a simple and intuitive selection method, and the inability to determine a precise point of fixation through eye position alone.",

        "abstract": "Homography normalization is presented as a novel gaze estimation method for uncalibrated setups. The method applies when head movements are present but without any requirements to camera calibration or geometric calibration. The method is geometrically and empirically demonstrated to be robust to head pose changes and despite being less constrained than cross-ratio methods, it consistently performs favorably by several degrees on both simulated data and data from physical setups. The physical setups include the use of off-the-shelf web cameras with infrared light (night vision) and standard cameras with and without infrared light. The benefits of homography normalization and uncalibrated setups in general are also demonstrated through obtaining gaze estimates (in the visible spectrum) using only the screen reflections on the cornea.",

        "abstract": "Currently, developmental psychologists rely on paradigms that use infants' looking behavior as the primary measure. Despite hundreds of studies describing infants' visual exploration of experimental stimuli, researchers know little about where infants look during everyday interactions. Head-mounted eye-trackers have provided many insights into natural vision in adults, but methods and equipment that work well with adults are not suitable for infants---the equipment is prohibitively big and calibration procedures too demanding. We outline the first method for studying mobile infants' visual behavior during natural interactions. We used a new, specially designed head-mounted eye-tracker to record 6 infants' gaze as they played with mothers in a room full of toys and obstacles. Using this method, we measured how infants employed gaze while navigating obstacles, manipulating objects, and interacting with mothers. Results revealed new insights into visually guided locomotor and manual action and social interaction.",

        "abstract": "Gaze estimation systems use calibration procedures that require active subject participation to estimate the point-of-gaze accurately. In these procedures, subjects are required to fixate on a specific point or points in space at specific time instances. This paper describes a gaze estimation system that does not use calibration procedures that require active user participation. The system estimates the optical axes of both eyes using images from a stereo pair of video cameras without a personal calibration procedure. To estimate the point-of-gaze, which lies along the visual axis, the angles between the optical and visual axes are estimated by a novel automatic procedure that minimizes the distance between the intersections of the visual axes of the left and right eyes with the surface of a display while subjects look naturally at the display (e.g., watching a video clip). Experiments with four subjects demonstrate that the RMS error of this point-of-gaze estimation system is 1.3Â°.",

        "abstract": "Relevance feedback (RF) mechanisms are widely adopted in Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems to improve image retrieval performance. However, there exist some intrinsic problems: (1) the semantic gap between high-level concepts and low-level features and (2) the subjectivity of human perception of visual contents. The primary focus of this paper is to evaluate the possibility of inferring the relevance of images based on eye movement data. In total, 882 images from 101 categories are viewed by 10 subjects to test the usefulness of implicit RF, where the relevance of each image is known beforehand. A set of measures based on fixations are thoroughly evaluated which include fixation duration, fixation count, and the number of revisits. Finally, the paper proposes a decision tree to predict the user's input during the image searching tasks. The prediction precision of the decision tree is over 87%, which spreads light on a promising integration of natural eye movement into CBIR systems in the future.",

        "abstract": "Image retrieval technology has been developed for more than twenty years. However, the current image retrieval techniques cannot achieve a satisfactory recall and precision. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of an image retrieval system, a novel content-based image retrieval method with a combination of image segmentation and eye tracking data is proposed in this paper. In the method, eye tracking data is collected by a non-intrusive table mounted eye tracker at a sampling rate of 120 Hz, and the corresponding fixation data is used to locate the human's Regions of Interest (hROIs) on the segmentation result from the JSEG algorithm. The hROIs are treated as important informative segments/objects and used in the image matching. In addition, the relative gaze duration of each hROI is used to weigh the similarity measure for image retrieval. The similarity measure proposed in this paper is based on a retrieval strategy emphasizing the most important regions. Experiments on 7346 Hemera color images annotated manually show that the retrieval results from our proposed approach compare favorably with conventional content-based image retrieval methods, especially when the important regions are difficult to be located based on visual features.",

However, there are many possibilities of how eye-trackers could be used in other disciplines like physics. A part of physics education research deals with the differences between novices and experts, specifically how each group solves problems. Though there has been a great deal of research about these differences there has been no research that focuses on noticing exactly where experts and novices look while solving the problems. Thus, to complement the past research, I have created a new technique called gaze scribing. Subjects wear a head mounted eye-tracker while solving electrical circuit problems on a graphics monitor. I monitor both scan patterns of the subjects and combine that with videotapes of their work while solving the problems. This new technique has yielded new information and elaborated on previous studies.",

Noton and Stark defined \"scanpaths\" as repetitive sequences of fixations and saccades that occur during exposure and subsequently upon re-exposure to a visual stimulus, facilitating recognition. Ten subjects watched a video of a staged theft in a parking lot. Scanpaths were recorded for the initial viewing of the suspect's face and a later close-up viewing of the suspect's face in the video, and then on the suspect's face when his picture appeared 24 hours later in a photo lineup constructed by law enforcement officers. These scanpaths were compared using the string-edit methodology to measure resemblance between sequences. Preliminary analysis showed support for repeated scanpath sub-sequences. In the analysis of four clusters of scanpaths, there was little within-subject resemblance between full scanpath sequences but seven of 10 subjects had repeated scanpath sub-sequences. When a subject's multiple scanpaths across the suspect's photo in the lineup were compared, instances of within-subjects repetition of short scanpaths occurred more often than expected due to chance.",

The procedure of estimating the response was developed with Support Vector Machines, using these features. The estimation performance and accuracy were assessed across combinations of features. The number of definition statements, which needed to be memorized to answer the question statements during the experiment, affected the estimation accuracy.

        "abstract": "There has been increased interest in reliable, non-intrusive methods of biometric identification due to the growing emphasis on security and increasing prevalence of identity theft. This paper presents a new biometric approach that involves an estimation of the unique oculomotor plant (OP) or eye globe muscle parameters from an eye movement trace. These parameters model individual properties of the human eye, including neuronal control signal, series elasticity, length tension, force velocity, and active tension. These properties can be estimated for each extraocular muscle, and have been shown to differ between individuals. We describe the algorithms used in our approach and the results of an experiment with 41 human subjects tracking a jumping dot on a screen. Our results show improvement over existing eye movement biometric identification methods. The technique of using Oculomotor Plant Mathematical Model (OPMM) parameters to model the individual eye provides a number of advantages for biometric identification: it includes both behavioral and physiological human attributes, is difficult to counterfeit, non-intrusive, and could easily be incorporated into existing biometric systems to provide an extra layer of security.",

If a specific task is imposed upon the viewer, then the image features that disambiguate task-related objects from non-task-related locations should be incorporated into the saliency determination as top-down information. For this study, viewers were given the task of locating potentially cancerous lesions in synthetically-generated medical images. An ensemble of saliency maps was created to model the target versus error features that attract attention. For MRI images, lesions are most reliably modeled by luminance features and errors are mostly modeled by color features, depending upon the type of error (search, recognition, or decision). Other imaging modalities showed similar differences between the target and error features that contribute to top-down saliency. This study provides evidence that image-derived saliency is task-dependent and may be used to predict target or error locations in complex images.",

The improvements of the human eye tracker interface become more and more important to allow medical doctors to increase their diagnosis capacity, especially if the interface allows them to remotely administer the clinical tests more appropriate for the problem at hand. In this paper, we propose a client/server eye tracking system that provides an interactive system for monitoring patients eye movements depending on the clinical test administered by the medical doctors.

In detail, after the retrieval of the images by querying CBIRs with a keyword, our system computes the most salient regions (where users look with a greater interest) of the retrieved images by gathering data from an unobtrusive eye tracker, such as Tobii T60. According to the features, in terms of color, texture, of these relevant regions our system is able to re-rank the images, initially, retrieved by the CBIR. Performance evaluation, carried out on a set of 30 users by using Google Images and \"pyramid\" like keyword, shows that about the 87% of the users is more satisfied of the output images when the re-raking is applied.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether viewers use similar visual information when asked to identify or describe animal motion PLDs and full representations. Participants were shown 20 videos of 10 animals, first as PLD and then in full resolution. After each video, participants were asked to select descriptive traits and to identify the animal represented.

Here we measure the natural coordination of eye and mouse pointer control across several search and selection tasks. We find that users automatically minimize the distance to likely targets in an intelligent, task dependent way. When target location is highly predictable, top-down knowledge can enable users to initiate pointer movements prior to target fixation. These findings question the utility of existing assistive pointing techniques and suggest that alternative approaches might be more effective.",

The whole system operates at a sample rate of 220 Hz, which allows the capture and reproduction of biological movements as precisely as possible while keeping the overall latency low.

In order to evaluate this assumption, we compared performance and eye-movement patterns in a visual search paradigm under different viewing conditions: participants either wore an HMD, had their field of view restricted by blinders or could avail themselves of an unrestricted field of view (normal viewing). From the head and eye-movement recordings we calculated the contribution of eye rotation to lateral shifts of attention. Results show that wearing an HMD leads to less eye rotation and requires more head movements than under blinders conditions and during normal viewing.",

Although the ideas are not novel, the algorithm also indicates how transparency of the heat map can be achieved and how the color gradient can be generated to represent the probability for an object to be observed within the defined visual span.

        "abstract": "Traditional cross-ratio methods (TCR) project a light pattern and use invariant properties of projective geometry to estimate the gaze position. Advantages of the TCR methods include robustness to large head movements and in general requires just a one time per user calibration. However, the accuracy of TCR methods decay significantly for head movements along the camera optical axis, mainly due to the angular difference between the optical and visual axis of the eye. In this paper we propose a depth compensation cross-ratio (DCR) method that improves the accuracy of TCR methods for large head depth variations. Our solution compensates the angular offset using a 2D onscreen vector computed from a simple calibration procedure. The length of the 2D vector, which varies with head distance, is adjusted by a scale factor that is estimated from relative size variations of the corneal reflection pattern. The proposed DCR solution was compared to a TCR method using synthetic and real data from 2 users. An average improvement of 40% was observed with synthetic data, and 8% with the real data.",

The physiological and performance measures show high correspondence suggesting that remote eye tracking might provide reliable driver cognitive load estimation, especially in simulators.

This paper discusses the developed application and the way in which the interaction techniques are included within the well-established environment of Word 2007. The additional interaction techniques are fully customizable and can be used in isolation or in combination. Eye gaze can be used with dwell time, look and shoot or blinking and speech recognition can be used for dictation and verbal commands for both formatting purposes and navigation through a document. Additionally, the look and shoot method can also be combined with a verbal command to facilitate a completely hands-free interaction.

We demonstrate that by using a greedy NystrÃ¶m algorithm on the eye movement features of different users, we can find a suitable low-dimensional feature space for learning. We validate the suitability of this feature space by projecting the eye movement features of a new user into this space, training an online learning algorithm using these features, and showing that the number of mistakes (regret over time) made in predicting relevant images is lower than when using the original eye movement features. We also plot Recall-Precision and ROC curves, and use a sign test to verify the statistical significance of our results.",

Regarding task completion time and ease of search result selection only in the list interface gaze-based interaction was inferior to mouse interaction.

The experimental results show that when the point-of-gaze was estimated using Listing's and Donders' laws there was no significant accuracy improvement relative to when eye torsion was ignored. While for a larger range of eye rotation the torsion would be more significant and should be taken into account, the torsion predicted by Listing's and Donders' laws may be inaccurate, even in ideal conditions. Moreover, eye torsion resulting from lateral head tilt can be significantly larger than the torsion predicted by Listing's and Donders' laws, and even have opposite direction. To properly account for eye torsion, it should be measured independently (e.g., by tracking the iris pattern and/or the scleral blood vessels).",

        "abstract": "Eye tracking scanpaths contain information about how people see, but traditional tangled, overlapping scanpath representations provide little insight about scanning strategies. The present work describes and extends several compact visual scanpath representations that can provide additional insight about individual and aggregate/multiple scanning strategies. Three categories of representations are introduced: (1) Scaled traces are small images of scanpaths as connected saccades, allowing the comparison of relative fixation densities and distributions of saccades. (2) Time expansions, substituting ordinal position for either the scanpath's x or y-coordinates, can uncover otherwise subtle horizontal or vertical reversals in visual scanning. (3) Radial plots represent scanpaths as a set of radial arms about an origin, with each arm representing saccade counts or lengths within a binned set of absolute or relative angles. Radial plots can convey useful shape characteristics of scanpaths, and can provide a basis for new metrics. Nine different prototype scanning strategies were represented by these plots, then heuristics were developed to classify the major strategies. The heuristics were subsequently applied to real scanpath data, to identify strategy trends. Future work will further automate the identification of scanning strategies to provide researchers with a tool to uncover and diagnose scanning-related challenges.",

Unlike previous measures that either use AOI sequences or forgo temporal order, the new measure defines scanpaths as a series of geometric vectors and compares temporally aligned scanpaths across several dimensions: shape, fixation position, length, direction, and fixation duration. This approach offers more multifaceted insights to how similar two scanpaths are. Eight fictitious scanpath pairs are tested to elucidate the strengths of the new measure, both in itself and compared to two of the currently most popular measures - the Levenshtein distance and attention map correlation.",

Matching sequences in the dotplot are found with linear regressions, and then used to cluster the scanpaths hierarchically. Aggregate scanning strategies are generated for each cluster and presented in an interactive dendrogram. While the clustering and aggregation method works in a bottom-up fashion, based on pair-wise matches, a top-down extension is also described, in which a scanning strategy is first input by cursor gesture, then matched against the dataset. The ability to discover both bottom-up and top-down strategy matches provides a powerful tool for scanpath analysis, and for understanding group scanning strategies.",

Instead the manipulations afforded are limited by formal structures of shapes. This research examines the potential for eye movement data to be used to recognise and make available for manipulation the perceived features in shapes. The objective of this study was to analyse eye movement data with the intention of recognising moments in which an interpretation of shape is made.

The point of intersection of the optical axis of the eye with the display is termed POA. By detecting the POAs of both the eyes, the POG is approximately estimated as the midpoint of the line joining the POAs of both the eyes on the basis of the binocular eye model; therefore, we can estimate the horizontal angles between the visual and the optical axes of both the eyes without requiring user calibration. We have developed a prototype system based on this method using a 19\" display with two pairs of stereo cameras. We evaluated the system experimentally with 20 subjects who were at a distance of 600 mm from the display. The result shows that the average of the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of measurement of POG in the display screen coordinate system is 16.55 mm (equivalent to less than 1.58Â°).",

The windows of pupil data thus selected are aligned by temporal translation and linear warping to place corresponding parts of the gaze patterns at corresponding times and then averaged together.

        "title": "Image ranking with implicit feedback from eye movements",
        "authors": "David R. Hardoon, Kitsuchart Pasupa",
        "abstract": "In order to help users navigate an image search system, one could provide explicit information on a small set of images as to which of them are relevant or not to their task. These rankings are learned in order to present a user with a new set of images that are relevant to their task. Requiring such explicit information may not be feasible in a number of cases, we consider the setting where the user provides implicit feedback, eye movements, to assist when performing such a task. This paper explores the idea of implicitly incorporating eye movement features in an image ranking task where only images are available during testing. Previous work had demonstrated that combining eye movement and image features improved on the retrieval accuracy when compared to using each of the sources independently. Despite these encouraging results the proposed approach is unrealistic as no eye movements will be presented a-priori for new images (i.e. only after the ranked images are presented would one be able to measure a user's eye movements on them). We propose a novel search methodology which combines image features together with implicit feedback from users' eye movements in a tensor ranking Support Vector Machine and show that it is possible to extract the individual source-specific weight vectors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decomposed image weight vector is able to construct a new image-based semantic space that outperforms the retrieval accuracy than when solely using the image-features.",

        "title": "How the interface design influences users' spontaneous trustworthiness evaluations of web search results: comparing a list and a grid interface",
        "authors": "Yvonne Kammerer, Peter Gerjets",
        "abstract": "This study examined to what extent users spontaneously evaluate the trustworthiness of Web search results presented by a search engine. For this purpose, a methodological paradigm was used in which the trustworthiness order of search results was experimentally manipulated by presenting search results on a search engine results page (SERP) either in a descending or ascending trustworthiness order. Moreover, a standard list format was compared to a grid format in order to examine the impact of the search results interface on Web users' evaluation processes. In an experiment addressing a controversial medical topic, 80 participants were assigned to one of four conditions with trustworthiness order (descending vs. ascending) and search results interface (list vs. grid) varied as between-subjects factors. In order to investigate participants' evaluation processes their eye movements and mouse clicks were captured during Web search. Results revealed that a list interface caused more homogenous and more linear viewing sequences on SERPs than a grid interface. Furthermore, when using a list interface most attention was given to the search results on top of the list. In contrast, with a grid interface nearly all search results on a SERP were attended to equivalently long. Consequently, in the ascending trustworthiness order participants using a list interface attended significantly longer to the least trustworthy search results and selected the most trustworthy search results significantly less often than participants using a grid interface. Thus, the presentation of Web search results by means of a grid interface seems to support users in their selection of trustworthy information sources.",

        "abstract": "We introduce an algorithm for space-variant filtering of video based on a spatio-temporal Laplacian pyramid and use this algorithm to render videos in order to visualize prerecorded eye movements. Spatio-temporal contrast and colour saturation are reduced as a function of distance to the nearest gaze point of regard, i.e. non-fixated, distracting regions are filtered out, whereas fixated image regions remain unchanged. Results of an experiment in which the eye movements of an expert on instructional videos are visualized with this algorithm, so that the gaze of novices is guided to relevant image locations, show that this visualization technique facilitates the novices' perceptual learning.",

        "abstract": "Eye typing could provide motor disabled people a reliable method of communication given that the text entry speed of current interfaces can be increased to allow for fluent communication. There are two reasons for the relatively slow text entry: dwell time selection requires waiting a certain time, and single character entry limits the maximum entry speed. We adopted a typing interface based on hierarchical pie menus, pEYEwrite [Urbina and Huckauf 2007] and included bigram text entry with one single pie iteration. Therefore, we introduced three different bigram building strategies. Moreover, we combined dwell time selection with selection by borders, providing an alternative selection method and extra functionality. In a longitudinal study we compared participants performance during character-by-character text entry with bigram entry and with text entry with bigrams derived by word prediction. Data showed large advantages of the new entry methods over single character text entry in speed and accuracy. Participants preferred selecting by borders, which allowed them faster selections than the dwell time method.",

        "abstract": "To enable people with motor impairments to use gaze control to play online games and take part in virtual communities, new interaction techniques are needed that overcome the limitations of dwell clicking on icons in the games interface. We have investigated gaze gestures as a means of achieving this. We report the results of an experiment with 24 participants that examined performance differences between different gestures. We were able to predict the effect on performance of the numbers of legs in the gesture and the primary direction of eye movement in a gesture. We also report the outcomes of user trials in which 12 experienced gamers used the gaze gesture interface to play World of Warcraft. All participants were able to move around and engage other characters in fighting episodes successfully. Gestures were good for issuing specific commands such as spell casting, and less good for continuous control of movement compared with other gaze interaction techniques we have developed.",

        "authors": "Marco Porta, Alice Ravarelli, Giovanni Spagnoli",
        "abstract": "Eye gaze interaction for disabled people is often dealt with by designing ad-hoc interfaces, in which the big size of their elements compensates for both the inaccuracy of eye trackers and the instability of the human eye. Unless solutions for reliable eye cursor control are employed, gaze pointing in ordinary graphical operating environments is a very difficult task. In this paper we present an eye-driven cursor for MS Windows which behaves differently according to the \"context\". When the user's gaze is perceived within the desktop or a folder, the cursor can be discretely shifted from one icon to another. Within an application window or where there are no icons, on the contrary, the cursor can be continuously and precisely moved. Shifts in the four directions (up, down, left, right) occur through dedicated buttons. To increase user awareness of the currently pointed spot on the screen while continuously moving the cursor, a replica of the spot is provided within the active direction button, resulting in improved pointing performance.",

The result, BlinkWrite2, is a text entry system for individuals with severe motor impairment. Since the ability to blink is often preserved, even in severe conditions such as locked-in syndrome, BlinkWrite2 allows text entry and correction with blinks as the only input modality. Advantages of BlinkWrite2 over its predecessor include an increase in text entry speed. In a user evaluation, 12 participants achieved an average text entry rate of 5.3 wpm, representing a 16% increase over BlinkWrite and a 657% increase over the next fastest video-based eye blink text entry system reported in the literature.",
