The topology of v considered consists of its critical points (where v=0), their invariant manifolds, and the integral curves connecting these invariant manifolds. The field in the neighborhood of each critical point is approximated by the Taylor expansion. The coefficients of the first nonzero term of the Taylor expansion around a critical point are the 3\u00d73 matrix ?v. Critical points are classified by examining ?v's eigenvalues. The eigenvectors of ?v span the invariant manifolds of the linearized field around a critical point. Curves integrated from initial points on the eigenvectors a small distance from a critical point connect with other critical points (or the boundary) to complete the topology. One class of critical surfaces that is important in computational fluid dynamics is analyzed.",

    "abstract": "Chemical reactions occurring within complex domains, such as fractals, can display behavior which differs radically from the expectation of classical chemical kinetics. Rather than relaxing to a uniform distribution at the steady state, these nonclassical systems display large-scale order on many scales. Such self-organization is difficult to measure using the usual statistical techniques, but is visually apparent. The authors discuss some of the problems of visualizing chemical kinetics in fractal domains and describe evolution of the visualization as the chemist and visualization scientist collaborated",

    "abstract": "The McClellan Air Force Base Installation Restoration Program (IRP), which is responsible for identifying and remedying environmental contamination from past operation and disposal practices, is considered. Since 1979, the IRP has generated over 200 volumes of technical reports regarding the degree and extent of contamination at the base. The base is in the process of automating the storage, retrieval, and analysis of the technical data generated by the cleanup program. The requirements for the IRP technical information system are discussed, the development approach taken is presented, visualization results from the system prototype are illustrated, and future plans for development of the system are outlined",

    "abstract": "Techniques for visualizing mathematical objects in four-dimensional (4D) space that exploit four-dimensional lighting effects are explored. The geometry of image production, stereography, and shadows in 4D is analyzed. Alternatives for smooth and specular shaded rendering of curves, surfaces, and solids in 4D are examined and a new approach that systematically converts curves or surfaces into uniquely renderable solids in 4D space by attaching spheres or circles to each point is proposed. Analogs of 3D shading methods are used to produce volume renderings that distinguish objects whose 3D projections from 4D are identical. Analyzing the procedures needed to justify and evaluate a system as this for teaching humans to `see' in four dimensions leads to the proposal of a generally applicable four-step visualization paradigm",
