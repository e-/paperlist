    "abstract": "A methodology has been developed for constructing streamlines and particle paths in numerically generated fluid velocity fields. A graphical technique is used to convert the discretely defined flow within a cell into one represented by two three-dimensional stream functions. Streamlines are calculated by tracking constant values of each stream function, a process which corresponds to finding the intersection of two stream surfaces. The tracking process is mass conservative and does not use a time stepping method for integration, thus eliminating a computationally intensive part of traditional tracking algorithms. The method can be applied generally to any three-dimensional compressible or incompressible steady flow. Results presented compare the performance of the new method to the most commonly used scheme and show that calculation times can be reduced by an order of magnitude",

The NASA Marshall Space Flight Center effort to develop the multidimensional analysis of sensor systems (MASS) environment is presented. Florida State University's building of a new scientific visualization package, Sci An, is reported. This is followed by a discussion of the design and implementation of VIS-AD, an experimental laboratory for developing scientific algorithms, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The visualization of global atmospheric data at IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center is highlighted",

    "abstract": "A three-dimensional finite-element hydrodynamic model was constructed to simulate tidal cycles in Galveston Bay over a one-year period in order to view changes in water velocities and salinity. A project undertaken to visualize the simulation results is reported. The project comprised analyzing model requirements and determining suitable visualization techniques, visualizing a preliminary, smaller-scale model to verify the techniques; and visualizing the full-scale model. Problems encountered and resolutions of problems at each stage are described. Validation, as well as insights revealed about the model through the preliminary and final visualization, are discussed. Current application of visualization techniques to the model is reported",

    "abstract": "A visualization technique that makes it possible to display and analyze line count profile data is described. The technique is to make a reduced picture of code with the line execution counts identified with color. Hot spots are shown in red, warm spots in orange, and so on. It is possible to identify nonexecuted code and nonexecutable code such as declarations and static tables",

    "abstract": "Experiments in visualizing implications of landscape planning and design decisions using a combination of GIS, CAD, and video animation technology are described. Simple grid-cell GIS databases and site-scale polygonal models are used to provide visualizations of site planning design proposals and environmental impact, with both static and animated images. Rather than pursuing photo-realistic simulations, the focus is on how abstractions and representational conventions can be used to gauge visual and environmental effects of proposals for landscape change, in a dynamic interactive computer-aided design environment",

    "abstract": "A Universe mapping project at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), called the CfA Redshift Survey, is described. The line-of-sight recession velocities of galaxies are measured by identifying absorption and emission lines in their spectra. With the two angular positions of a galaxy on the sky and a measurement of its red-shift, each galaxy can be placed in a three-dimensional (3-D) map of the Universe. It is shown that visualization techniques are important for exploring and analyzing the data, for comparing the data with models, and for designing the future. Computer animation of the data is a way of bringing the maps before the public",

    "abstract": "A prototype implementation of a splatting volume renderer (SVR) on a commercially available distributed memory MIMD (multiple instruction stream, multiple data stream) parallel processor, the nCUBE2, is described. Some relatively good rendering times can be achieved with the nCUBE SVR. Message-passing bottlenecks occur when large numbers of floating-point values have to be collected from every processor for every picture. For large images this is a severe limitation. An initial implementation of a SVR on a distributed memory parallel computer demonstrates the need for parallel computers with high-bandwidth connections between processors, and also for new parallelizable volume rendering algorithms",

Parry (1986) and S. Coquillart (1990), is presented. The process is accelerated to near-real-time speed, and the compromises that are made to effect such speeds are explained. This technique expands the repertoire of volumetric modeling techniques and can be applied to any form of volumetric data",
