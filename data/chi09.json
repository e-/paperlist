        "abstract": "In this paper, we report a study that examines the relationship between image-based computational analyses of web pages and users' aesthetic judgments about the same image material. Web pages were iteratively decomposed into quadrants of minimum entropy (quadtree decomposition) based on low-level image statistics, to permit a characterization of these pages in terms of their respective organizational symmetry, balance and equilibrium. These attributes were then evaluated for their correlation with human participants' subjective ratings of the same web pages on four aesthetic and affective dimensions. Several of these correlations were quite large and revealed interesting patterns in the relationship between low-level (i.e., pixel-level) image statistics and design-relevant dimensions.",

We present an eye-tracking study in which 20 users viewed 361 Web pages while engaged in information foraging and page recognition tasks. From this data, we describe general location-based characteristics of visual attention for Web pages dependent on different tasks and demographics, and generate a model for predicting the visual attention that individual page elements may receive. Finally, we introduce the concept of fixation impact, a new method for mapping gaze data to visual scenes that is motivated by findings in vision research.",

Using signaling theory as a conceptual framework, we describe how certain 'signals' in various social software are hard to fake, and are thus more reliable indicators of expertise. Multi-level regression analysis revealed that participation in social software, social connection information, and self-described expertise in the corporate directory were significantly helpful in the decision to contact someone for expertise. Qualitative analysis provided further insights regarding the interpretations people form of others' expertise from digital artifacts.

The usefulness of improvisation for brainstorming stems from the similarity of the goals of improvisation and brainstorming, the similarity of the recurrent problems that actors and designers encounter when collaborating, and the distinctness of the ways each have devised to resolve the problems that block the group's performance.

Two user trials of the game successfully produced an archive of geo-located photographs and tags, and in a follow-up experiment we compared performance in a navigation task using photographs from the game, with geo-referenced photos collected from the Flickr website.

We have classified these scenarios according to region of interest (ROI) with analogies to different eye movement types (fixed, saccadic, and pursuit ROI). Empirical data gathered during the course of a multi-faceted user study demonstrates that the steerable focus region system significantly outperforms the fixed focus region system. The former is shown to provide enhanced display manipulation and proves especially advantageous in cases where the user must maintain spatial awareness of the display content as is the case in which, within a single session, several regions of the display are to be visited.",

Displaying a person's photo stabilized both response strategies and liking of a recommender's poor suggestions.

In this paper, we report findings from a qualitative study investigating the work practices and tools of nine mathematicians in a research setting. Counter to our expectations, our data suggests that computational tools play only a minor role in their workflow, with the limited use of CAS owing primarily to four factors: (1) the need for transparency in CAS's reasoning to explain computed results; (2) the problem of rigidity and formality in CAS's input/output style dialogue; (3) the need for 2D input to support a wide range of annotations, diagrams, and in-place manipulation of objects of interest; and (4) the need for collaboration, particularly in early stages of problem solving.

In this paper, we present in-depth results from an in situ, longitudinal study of an activity-based computing system, Giornata. We detail the ways that the specific features of this system influenced the everyday work experiences of a small cohort of knowledge workers. Our analysis provides contributions at several levels of granularity-we provide concrete design recommendations based on participants' reactions to the particular features of the Giornata system and a discussion about how our findings can provide insight about the broader understanding of knowledge work and activity within HCI.",

        "abstract": "Users find it hard to delete unimportant personal information which often results in cluttered workspaces. We present a full design cycle for GrayArea, a novel interface that allows users to demote unimportant files by dragging them to a gray area at the bottom of their file folders. Demotion is an intermediate option between keeping and deleting. It combines the advantages of deletion (unimportant files don't compete for attention) and keeping (files are retrieved in their folder context). We developed the GrayArea working prototype using thorough iterative design. We evaluated it by asking 96 participants to 'clean' two folders with, and without, GrayArea. Using GrayArea reduced folder clutter by 13%. Further, 81% of participants found it easier to demote than delete files, and most indicated they would use GrayArea if provided in their operating systems. The results provide strong evidence for the demotion principle suggested by the user-subjective approach.",

We deployed TAGtivity and studied users' tagging practices in their actual work places over a three week period. Our analysis of interviews and logs reveals that affordances of the TAGtivity system supported users in a variety of information and activity management tasks.

        "abstract": "We present a novel method called motion-pointing for selecting a set of visual items such as push-buttons without actually pointing to them. Instead, each potential target displays a rhythmically animated point we call the driver. To select a specific item, the user only has to imitate the motion of its driver using the input device. Once the motion has been recognized by the system, the user can confirm the selection to trigger the action. We consider cyclic motions on an elliptic trajectory with a specific period, and study the most effective methods for real-time matching such a trajectory, as well as the range of parameters a human can reliably reproduce. We then show how to implement motion-pointing in real applications using an interaction technique we call move-and-stroke. Finally, we measure the throughput and error rate of move-and-stroke in a controlled experiment. We show that the selection time is linearly proportional to the number of input bits conveyed up to 6 bits, confirming that motion-pointing is a practical input method.",

        "abstract": "Physical buttons have the unique ability to provide low-attention and vision-free interactions through their intuitive tactile clues. Unfortunately, the physicality of these interfaces makes them static, limiting the number and types of user interfaces they can support. On the other hand, touch screen technologies provide the ultimate interface flexibility, but offer no inherent tactile qualities. In this paper, we describe a technique that seeks to occupy the space between these two extremes - offering some of the flexibility of touch screens, while retaining the beneficial tactile properties of physical interfaces. The outcome of our investigations is a visual display that contains deformable areas, able to produce physical buttons and other interface elements. These tactile features can be dynamically brought into and out of the interface, and otherwise manipulated under program control. The surfaces we describe provide the full dynamics of a visual display (through rear projection) as well as allowing for multitouch input (though an infrared lighting and camera setup behind the display). To illustrate the tactile capabilities of the surfaces, we describe a number of variations we uncovered in our exploration and prototyping. These go beyond simple on/off actuation and can be combined to provide a range of different possible tactile expressions. A preliminary user study indicates that our dynamic buttons perform much like physical buttons in tactile search tasks.",

To provide a richer context, the second study contrasts locativeness with other traditional aspects of design: branding and quality.

The results indicate that users' trust in other community members, and the community's information sharing norms have a negative impact on community-specific privacy concerns. We also find that community-specific privacy concerns not only lead users to adopt more restrictive information sharing settings, but also reduce the amount of information they share with the community. In addition, we find that information sharing is impacted by network centrality and the tenure of the user in the community. Implications of the study for research and practice are discussed.",

The system has two main components-a vibrating 'Haptic Chair' and a computer display of informative visual effects that correspond to features of the music. The Haptic Chair provides sensory input of vibrations via touch. This system was developed based on an initial concept guided by information obtained from a background survey conducted with deaf people from multi-ethnic backgrounds and feedback received from two profoundly deaf musicians. A formal user study with 43 deaf participants suggested that the prototype system enhances the musical experience of a deaf person. All of the users preferred either the Haptic Chair alone (54%) or the Haptic Chair with the visual display (46%). The prototype system, especially the Haptic Chair was so enthusiastically received by our subjects that it is possible this system might significantly change the way the deaf community experiences music.",

We alter the video image by framing the display such that, in one condition, only the head is visible while, in the other condition, the entire upper body is visible. We include a F2F control case. We used two measures of dyad empathy and found a significant difference between head-only framing and both upper-body framing and F2F, but no significant difference between upper-body framing and F2F. Based on these and earlier results, we present some design heuristics for video conferencing systems. We revisit earlier negative experimental results on video systems in the light of these new experiments. We conclude that for systems that preserve both gaze and upper-body cues, there is no evidence of deficit in communication effectiveness compared to face-to-face meetings.",

Despite the camera's movement, subjects believed that the camera did not move and a zoom-in function expanded the image. Surprisingly, a zoom-in camera that expanded the image as the movable camera did, however, was ineffective probably because of a lack of motion parallax. Although we explained nothing about the camera, most subjects noticed that their walking caused the view's expansion.

This similarity in language between ASD and NT authors suggests that communication deficits routinely found in people with ASD may be due to the social context in which their communication skills are tested, and that the affordances of asynchronous computer-mediated communication may offer alternative means of testing and expression.",

Novel automated and manual analysis techniques identify linguistic similarity at content, structural and stylistic levels. Results reveal that certain types of content (some positive emotion words, task-related words), structural (verb tense, phrasal entrainment), and stylistic (emoticons) similarity characterize high trusting pairs while other types of similarity (e.g., negative emotion words) characterize low trusting pairs. Contrary to previous literature, this suggests that not all similarity is good similarity.",

        "abstract": "While most collaboration technologies are concerned with supporting particular tasks such as workflows or meetings, many work groups do not have the teamwork skills essential to effective collaboration. One way to improve teamwork is to provide dynamic feedback generated by automated analyses of behavior, such as language use. Such feedback can lead members to reflect on and subsequently improve their collaborative behavior, but might also distract from the task at hand. We have experimented with GroupMeter - a chat-based system that presents visual feedback on team members' language use. Feedback on proportion of agreement words and overall word count was presented using two different designs. When receiving feedback, teams in our study expressed more agreement in their conversations and reported greater focus on language use as compared to when not receiving feedback. This suggests that automated, real-time linguistic feedback can elicit behavioral changes, offering opportunities for future research.",

We provide an analysis of the problems in this application genre that presentation authors face and present Fly, a presentation tool that is based on the idea of planar information structures. Inspired by the natural human thought processes of data chunking, association, and spatial memory, Fly explores authoring of presentation documents. Evaluation of a paper prototype showed that the planar UI is easily grasped by users, and leads to presentations more closely resembling the information structure of the original content, thus providing better authoring support than the slide metaphor. Our software prototype confirmed these results, and outperformed PowerPoint in a second study for tasks such as prototyping presentations and generating meaningful overviews. Users reported that this interface helped them better to express their concepts, and expressed significant preference for Fly over the traditional slide model.",

Our results show that the pen, hand, and forearm can occlude up to 47% of a 12 inch display. The shape of the occluded area varies between participants due to differences in pen grip rather than simply anatomical differences. For the most part, individuals adopt a consistent posture for long and short selection tasks. Overall, many occluded pixels are located higher relative to the pen than previously thought. From the experimental data, a five-parameter scalable circle and pivoting rectangle geometric model is presented which captures the general shape of the occluded area relative to the pen position. This model fits the experimental data much better than the simple bounding box model often used implicitly by designers. The space of fitted parameters also serves to quantify the shape of occlusion. Finally, an initial design for a predictive version of the model is discussed.",

Inspired by art diagnostic techniques, this tactile method could have distinct advantages in the general domain as shown by our user study. We propose that the physical metaphor of scraping facilitates the process of determining correlations between layers of an image because it compresses the process of planning, comparison and annotation into a single gesture.

We compared (1) low-effort tagging by mouse-clicking (Click2Tag), (2) traditional tagging by typing (type-to-tag), and (3) baseline, no tagging conditions. Our results suggest that (a) Click2Tag increases tagging rates, (b) Click2Tag improves recognition of facts from the tagged text when compared to type-to-tag, and (c) Click2Tag is comparable to the no-tagging baseline condition on recall measures. Results suggest that tagging by clicking strengthens the memory traces by repeated readings of relevant words in the text and, thus, improves recognition.",

A Multi-Dimensional Scaling approach that accounts for the diverse views on a set of stimuli is proposed and its added value is illustrated using published data. We will illustrate that the averaging analysis provides insight to only 1/6th of the total number of attributes in the example dataset. The proposed approach accounts for more than double the information obtained from the average model, and provides richer and semantically diverse views on the set of stimuli.",

We compared problems identified using undo and erase events to problems identified using the user-reported critical incident technique [Hartson and Castillo 1998]. In a within-subjects experiment with 35 participants, undo and erase episodes together revealed over 90% of the problems rated as severe, several of which would not have been discovered by self-report alone. Moreover, problems found by all three methods were rated as significantly more severe than those identified by only a subset of methods.

Consequently, our study suggests the importance of not only grounding between speaker and addressee but also grounding between addressees in constructing effective machine-translation-mediated communication. Furthermore, to successfully build common ground between addressees, it seems important for them to be able to monitor what is going on between a speaker and other addressees.",

One major component of this problem is the prevalence of conversational questions, identified both by Q&A sites and academic literature as questions that are intended simply to start discussion. For example, a conversational question such as \"do you believe in evolution?\" might successfully engage users in discussion, but probably will not yield a useful web page for users searching for information about evolution. Using data from three popular Q&A sites, we confirm that humans can reliably distinguish between these conversational questions and other informational questions, and present evidence that conversational questions typically have much lower potential archival value than informational questions. Further, we explore the use of machine learning techniques to automatically classify questions as conversational or informational, learning in the process about categorical, linguistic, and social differences between different question types.

We present Storied Navigation, a video editing system that helps authors compose a sequence of scenes that tell a story, by selecting from a corpus of annotated clips.

When expressing musical ideas, composers draw in a precise way, not just sketch. Working in close collaboration with composers, we designed Musink to provide them with a smooth transition between paper drawings and OpenMusic, a flexible music composition tool. Musink's built-in recognizers handle common needs, such as scoping and annotation. Users can also define new gestures and associate them with their own or predefined software functions. Musink supports semi-structured, delayed interpretation and serves as a customizable gesture browser, giving composers significant freedom to create their own, individualized composition languages and to experiment with music, on-paper and on-line.",

We have conducted a study of a passive camera device called Sensecam, which previously has been investigated as a memory aid, a combination of life-logging and memory tool and as a resource for digital narratives. We take a creative perspective and show that even if a camera is designed to be forgotten in use (i.e. is worn as a necklace and takes pictures automatically) it can still be part of an engaging or active photographic experience. Because Sensecam is different from film cameras, camera phones and other digital cameras, it involves a different type of photographic experience, for example when moving through different social contexts and how the resulting pictures are appreciated. The findings stem from people who used the camera for a week. This is complemented with reflections from the researcher, who has been using the camera for a month.",

In this paper, we explore the potential of physically instantiated pixels that enable flexible, reconfigurable, unbounded, low-resolution, and responsive urban displays. Urban Pixels are nodes in a wireless network of physical pixels for urban spaces. Each pixel unit includes a microcontroller, RF transceiver (433 MHz), LED module (ten bright, white LEDs), rechargeable Li-Ion battery pack, IR sensor and renewable energy source such as photo-voltaic cells. Two acrylic half-spheres (4-inch diameter) protect the components from the elements. No additional wiring is needed for communication and the units can be mounted individually to any surface. A small-scale prototype network of fifty Urban Pixels was displayed on a fa√ßade of Eden Court Theater in Inverness, Scotland from June 1 - June 7, 2008. The public was encouraged to change display patterns via SMS or to interact with individual units via flashlights. We observed and informally interviewed theater guests and passers-by interacting with the fa√ßade for several nights. Based on these results, we outline an exciting problem space for designing displays and lighting systems in cities.",

It enables non-technical users, such as parents, teachers, game developers and psychologists, to specify applications by themselves. The SDK allows them to start off quickly with developing simple applications. Then, as their programming skills increase with experience, the SDK supports them to create more complex applications. This is achieved by offering a complete tool chain with one, consistent programming paradigm. Each link is a separate tool offering a tailored amount of flexibility and complexity. To ensure that users can understand the feedback the SDK provides them, it is given in terms of the tool currently used. Furthermore, by preventing runtime errors, a user can be sure a program will work correctly if it compiles. We validated the ESPranto SDK partially by tests, but mainly by monitoring users applying the SDK. In practice the ESPranto SDK indeed proved to meet its design goals for all of its intended users.",

        "abstract": "Intelligibility and control are important user concerns in context-aware applications. They allow a user to understand why an application is behaving a certain way, and to change its behavior. Because of their importance to end users, they must be addressed at an interface level. However, often the sensors or machine learning systems that users need to understand and control are created long before a specific application is built, or created separately from the application interface. Thus, supporting interface designers in building intelligibility and control into interfaces requires application logic and underlying infrastructure to be exposed in some structured fashion. As context-aware infrastructures do not provide generalized support for this, we extended one such infrastructure with Situations, components that appropriately exposes application logic, and supports debugging and simple intelligibility and control interfaces, while making it easier for an application developer to build context-aware applications and facilitating designer access to application state and behavior. We developed support for interface designers in Visual Basic and Flash. We demonstrate the usefulness of this support through an evaluation of programmers, an evaluation of the usability of the new infrastructure with interface designers, and the augmentation of three common context-aware applications.",

This paper presents the first study of multiple graphical passwords to systematically examine frequency of access to a graphical password, interference resulting from interleaving access to multiple graphical passwords, and patterns of access while training multiple graphical passwords. We find that all of these factors significantly impact the ease of authenticating using multiple facial graphical passwords. For example, participants who accessed four different graphical passwords per week were ten times more likely to completely fail to authenticate than participants who accessed a single password once per week. Our results underscore the need for more realistic evaluations of the use of multiple graphical passwords, have a number of implications for the adoption of graphical password systems, and provide a new basis for comparing proposed graphical password systems.",

User observation, interview and survey techniques were applied to investigate attitudes towards two types of filters: a user-adaptive (trainable) and a rule-based filter. While many of our participants invested extensive effort in training their filters, training did not influence filter trust. Instead, the findings indicate that users' filter awareness and understanding seriously impacts attitudes and behaviour.

Therefore, designers of SNS seek to improve the overall user experience by encouraging members to contribute more content. However, user motivations for contribution in SNS are not well understood. This is particularly true for newcomers, who may not recognize the value of contribution. Using server log data from approximately 140,000 newcomers in Facebook, we predict long-term sharing based on the experiences the newcomers have in their first two weeks. We test four mechanisms: social learning, singling out, feedback, and distribution. In particular, we find support for social learning: newcomers who see their friends contributing go on to share more content themselves. For newcomers who are initially inclined to contribute, receiving feedback and having a wide audience are also predictors of increased sharing. On the other hand, singling out appears to affect only those newcomers who are not initially inclined to share. The paper concludes with design implications for motivating newcomer sharing in online communities.",

A correlation and regression analysis confirms that these dimensions are related to the helpfulness scores assigned by community participants.

A survey study among Facebook users was conducted to test this hypothesis. Results showed that diversity of the Facebook network predicted online tension. Moreover, the number of kin in a Facebook network was a crucial component because it predicted online tension whereas number of work and social contacts did not. Further, evidence was found to support the idea that tension might impose an upper limit on network size. We conclude with a discussion of these findings and describe how they support the thrust of recent modifications to SNS designs.",

Our results show that visitors found the tangible and the graphical systems equally easy to understand. However, with the tangible interface, visitors were significantly more likely to try the exhibit and significantly more likely to actively participate in groups. In turn, we show that regardless of the condition, involving multiple active participants leads to significantly longer interaction times.

In a formal study, the SDMouse was shown to significantly improve performance in comparison to previously developed mouse emulation techniques.",

        "abstract": "Many surface computing prototypes have employed gestures created by system designers. Although such gestures are appropriate for early investigations, they are not necessarily reflective of user behavior. We present an approach to designing tabletop gestures that relies on eliciting gestures from non-technical users by first portraying the effect of a gesture, and then asking users to perform its cause. In all, 1080 gestures from 20 participants were logged, analyzed, and paired with think-aloud data for 27 commands performed with 1 and 2 hands. Our findings indicate that users rarely care about the number of fingers they employ, that one hand is preferred to two, that desktop idioms strongly influence users' mental models, and that some commands elicit little gestural agreement, suggesting the need for on-screen widgets. We also present a complete user-defined gesture set, quantitative agreement scores, implications for surface technology, and a taxonomy of surface gestures. Our results will help designers create better gesture sets informed by user behavior.",

Our techniques rely on the images being broken into image segments, which are then recombined or displayed in novel ways. The techniques and their underlying design reasoning are described in detail, and three experiments are presented that provide initial evidence that these techniques lead to better search performance in a simulated cell slide pathology task.",

To reduce the cost of creating QCDs, we developed Graph Sketcher, a quantitative graphing tool that deeply integrates the data plotting capabilities of charting programs with the direct manipulation techniques of illustration programs. We show that our integrated interface substantially reduces the time needed to create QCDs, and we further show that real Graph Sketcher users both enjoy and take advantage of the interface improvements to create QCDs in a wide range of fields.",

In this paper, we report on a study investigating these issues through a questionnaire administered to more than a hundred users of three virtual worlds offering widely different avatar creation and customization systems (Maple Story, World of Warcraft, and Second Life). We illustrate the often-surprising choices users make when creating their digital representation and discuss the impact of our findings for the design of future avatar creation systems.",

We compare several algorithms for combining these relative judgments between pairs of images into a total ordering of all images and present a new algorithm to perform collaborative filtering on pair-wise relative judgments.

This paper explores a psychological explanation of the self-as-user outlook through Empathizing-Systemizing theory, including a large-scale study (n = 441) of men and women working in the Information Technology field.

We perceive regions grouped by proximity and feature similarity, grouping of curves by good continuation, and grouping of regions of coherent texture. In this paper, we discuss a simple model for a broad range of perceptual grouping phenomena. It takes as input an arbitrary image, and returns a structure describing the predicted visual organization of the image.

The fit of the model to user data provides a quantitative assessment of user behavior, which is useful in assessing individual differences and the progression from novice- to expert-level proficiency.

        "abstract": "Communicating the subtleties of a craft technique, like putting a zipper into a garment or throwing a clay pot, can be challenging even when working side by side. Yet How-To content - including text, images, animations, and videos - is available online for a wide variety of crafts. We interviewed people engaged in various crafts to investigate how online resources contributed to their craft practice. We found that participants sought creative inspiration as well as technical clarification online. In this domain, keyword search can be difficult, so supplemental strategies are used. Participants sought information iteratively, because they often needed to enact their knowledge in order to evaluate it. Our description of people learning how allows us to elaborate existing understandings of information-seeking behavior by considering how search originates and is evaluated in knowledge domains involving physical objects and physical processes.",

This paper explores the relationship between Web page content change (obtained from an hourly crawl of over 40K pages) and people's revisitation to those pages (collected via a large scale log analysis of 2.3M users). We identify the relationship, or resonance, between revisitation behavior and the amount and type of changes on those pages. By coupling our large scale log analysis with a complementary user study we explore the intent behind the revisitation behavior we observed. Using the notion of resonance to identify the likely content of interest, we describe a number of ways interaction with changing and revisited information can be better supported. We illustrate how understanding the association between change and revisitation might improve browser, crawler, and search engine design, and present a specific example of how knowledge of both can enable relevant content to be highlighted.",

DynaSpot couples the cursor's activation area with its speed, behaving like a point cursor at low speed or when motionless. This technique minimizes visual distraction and allows pointing anywhere in empty space without requiring an explicit mode switch, thus enabling users to perform common interactions such as region selections seamlessly. The results of our controlled experiments show that the performance of DynaSpot can be modeled by Fitts' law, and that DynaSpot significantly outperforms the point cursor and achieves, in most conditions, the same level of performance as one of the most promising techniques to date, the Bubble cursor.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel method of dynamic C-D gain adaptation that improves target acquisition for users with motor impairments. Our method, called the Angle Mouse, adjusts the mouse C-D gain based on the deviation of angles sampled during movement. When angular deviation is low, the gain is kept high. When angular deviation is high, the gain is dropped, making the target bigger in motor-space. A key feature of the Angle Mouse is that, unlike most pointing facilitation techniques, it is target-agnostic, requiring no knowledge of target locations or dimensions. This means that the problem of distractor targets is avoided because adaptation is based solely on the user's behavior. In a study of 16 people, 8 of which had motor impairments, we found that the Angle Mouse improved motor-impaired pointing throughput by 10.3% over the Windows default mouse and 11.0% over sticky icons. For able-bodied users, there was no significant difference among the three techniques, as Angle Mouse throughput was within 1.2% of the default. Thus, the Angle Mouse improved pointing performance for users with motor impairments while remaining unobtrusive for able-bodied users.",

A controlled experiment shows that rake cursor pointing drastically outperforms mouse-only pointing and also significantly outperforms the state of the art of pointing techniques mixing gaze and mouse input.

We explored this idea in three studies with a total of over 600 participants. Study 1 revealed a reluctance to pay for beauty due to its hedonic nature (i.e., associated with luxury etc.). Study 2 showed that people prefer a more beautiful product, but justify their choice by referring to spurious advantages in usability. Finally, Study 3 revealed that a choice situation which requires a trade-off between beauty and usability, and which offers no further way to justify choosing beauty, leads to a sharp increase in the preference of usability. The underlying reasons for this \"beauty dilemma\" and further implications are discussed.",

However, unlike many other examples of collective intelligence, tasks in Wikipedia can be deeply interdependent and may incur high coordination costs among editors. Increasing the number of editors increases the resources available to the system, but it also raises the costs of coordination. This suggests that the dependencies of tasks in Wikipedia may determine whether they benefit from increasing the number of editors involved. Specifically, we hypothesize that adding editors may benefit low-coordination tasks but have negative consequences for tasks requiring a high degree of coordination. Furthermore, concentrating the work to reduce coordination dependencies should enable more efficient work by many editors. Analyses of both article ratings and article review comments provide support for both hypotheses. These results suggest ways to better harness the efforts of many editors in social collaborative systems involving high coordination tasks.",

We found that programmers leverage online resources with a range of intentions: They engage in just-in-time learning of new skills and approaches, clarify and extend their existing knowledge, and remind themselves of details deemed not worth remembering. The results also suggest that queries for different purposes have different styles and durations. Do programmers' queries \"in the wild\" have the same range of intentions, or is this result an artifact of the particular lab setting? We analyzed a month of queries to an online programming portal, examining the lexical structure, refinements made, and result pages visited.

In this paper, we report from an empirical study where we systematically compared three methods for remote asynchronous usability testing: user-reported critical incidents, forum-based online reporting and discussion, and diary-based longitudinal user reporting. In addition, conventional laboratory-based think-aloud testing was included as a benchmark for the remote methods. The results show that each remote asynchronous method supports identification of a considerable number of usability problems. Although this is only about half of the problems identified with the conventional method, it requires significantly less time. This makes remote asynchronous methods an appealing possibility for usability testing in many software projects.",

        "authors": "Duncan P. Brumby, Dario D. Salvucci, Andrew Howes",
        "abstract": "We investigate how people adapt their strategy for interleaving multiple concurrent tasks to varying objectives. A study was conducted in which participants drove a simulated vehicle and occasionally dialed a telephone number on a mobile phone. Experimental instructions and feedback encouraged participants to focus on either driving or dialing. Results show that participants adapted their task interleaving strategies to meet the required task objective, but in a manner that was nonetheless intricately shaped by internal psychological constraints. In particular, participants tended to steer in between dialing chunks of digits even when extreme vehicle drift implied that more reactive strategies would have generated better lane keeping. To better understand why drivers interleaved tasks at chunk boundaries, a modeling analysis was conducted to derive performance predictions for a range of dialing strategies. The analysis supported the idea that interleaving at chunk boundaries efficiently traded the time given up to dialing with the maintenance of a central lane position. We discuss the implications of this work in terms of contributions to understanding how cognitive constraints shape strategy adaptations in dynamic multitask environments.",

To demonstrate the benefit of ephemeral adaptation we conducted two experiments with a total of 48 users to show: (1) that ephemeral adaptive menus are faster than static menus when accuracy is high, and are not significantly slower when it is low and (2) that ephemeral adaptive menus are also faster than adaptive highlighting.

We found that older adults performed worse than younger adults in well-defined tasks, but the reverse was true in ill-defined tasks. Older adults compensated for their lower cognitive abilities by adopting a top-down knowledge-driven strategy to achieve the same level of performance in the ill-defined tasks. Indeed, path models showed that cognitive abilities, health literacy, and knowledge influenced search strategies adopted by older and younger adults. Design implications are also discussed.",

In this paper, we present two studies that provide preliminary answers to these questions. We first investigated the usability of existing mobile payment services, through an ethnographic study involving 90 subjects in India, Kenya, the Philippines and South Africa. This was followed by a usability study with another 58 subjects in India, in which we compared non-literate and semi-literate subjects on three systems: text-based, spoken dialog (without text), and rich multimedia (also without text). Results confirm that non-text designs are strongly preferred over text-based designs and that while task-completion rates are better for the rich multimedia UI, speed is faster and less assistance is required on the spoken-dialog system.",

We conducted two studies that explore how semiliterate users with very little education might benefit from a combination of text and audio as compared to illiterate and literate users. Results show that semiliterate users reduced their use of audio support even during the first hour of use and over several hours this reduction was accompanied by a gain in visual word recognition; illiterate users showed no similar improvement. Semiliterate users should thus be treated differently from illiterate users in interface design.",

The problem, it is suggested, may be fixed if the equivocalness of the fractional expression D/W that appears on the right-hand side of Fitts' law equations is acknowledged. This two-degree-of-freedom expression can be taken to specify either D and W or the form F and the scale S of the movement task.

After developing and refining a set of interfaces to present the verification of Kylin extractions as a non primary task in the context of Wikipedia articles, we develop an innovative use of Web search advertising services to study people engaged in some other primary task. We demonstrate our proposed synergy by analyzing our deployment from two complementary perspectives: (1) we show we accelerate community content creation by using Kylin's information extraction to significantly increase the likelihood that a person visiting a Wikipedia article as a part of some other primary task will spontaneously choose to help improve the article's infobox, and (2) we show we accelerate information extraction by using contributions collected from people interacting with our designs to significantly improve Kylin's extraction performance.",

They then populate the form with the desired results, demonstrating to the agent the steps required to retrieve the information. This method of form creation explicitly defines the shared understanding between human and agent. An evaluation of the interface shows that administrators can effectively create forms to communicate with the agent, that they are likely to accept this technology in their work environment, and that the agent's help can significantly reduce the time they spend on repeated information-retrieval tasks.",

        "abstract": "Visual markers are graphic symbols designed to be easily recognised by machines. They are traditionally used to track goods, but there is increasing interest in their application to mobile HCI. By scanning a visual marker through a camera phone users can retrieve localised information and access mobile services. One missed opportunity in current visual marker systems is that the markers themselves cannot be visually designed, they are not expressive to humans, and thus fail to convey information before being scanned. This paper provides an overview of d-touch, an open source system that allows users to create their own markers, controlling their aesthetic qualities. The system runs in real-time on mobile phones and desktop computers. To increase computational efficiency d-touch imposes constraints on the design of the markers in terms of the relationship of dark and light regions in the symbols. We report a user study in which pairs of novice users generated between 3 and 27 valid and expressive markers within one hour of being introduced to the system, demonstrating its flexibility and ease of use.",

On first sight, touchscreens seem to allow for particular compactness, because they integrate input and screen into the same physical space. The opposite is true, however, because the user's fingers occlude contents and prevent precision. We argue that the key to touch-enabling very small devices is to use touch on the device backside. In order to study this, we have created a 2.4\" prototype device; we simulate screens smaller than that by masking the screen. We present a user study in which participants completed a pointing task successfully across display sizes when using a back-of device interface. The touchscreen-based control condition (enhanced with the shift technique), in contrast, failed for screen diagonals below 1 inch. We present four form factor concepts based on back-of-device interaction and provide design guidelines extracted from a second user study.",

In a first study, we investigate the various factors that can influence tilt control, separately along the three axes of wrist movement: flexion/extension, pronation/supination, and ulnar/radial deviation. Results show that users can control comfortably at least 16 levels on the pronation/supination axis and that using a quadratic mapping function for discretization of tilt space significantly improves user performance across all tilt axes.

The system employs trustees previously appointed by the account holder to verify the account holder's identity. We ran three experiments to determine whether the system could (1) reliably authenticate account holders, (2) resist email attacks that target trustees by impersonating account holders, and (3) resist phone-based attacks from individuals close to account holders. Results were encouraging: seventeen of the nineteen participants who made the effort to call trustees authenticated successfully.

We found that a change in physical location, sufficient convenience, visibility of the information, and permanency of information account for some, but not all, of the outcome. As well, we found that computerization of the nursing data led to a shift in the politics of the information itself - the nurses no longer had a cohesive agreement about the kinds of data to enter into the system. The findings address the requirements of healthcare computerization to support both formal and informal work practices, respecting the nature of nursing work and the politics of information inherent in complex medical work.",

Broadly, it is suggested that ordinary, everyday ideas of intelligence are not fixed, but rather actively seen and enacted in the world. As such, intelligence does not just belong to the province of the human mind, but can emerge in quite different, unexpected forms in things. For HCI, it is proposed this opens up a new set of possibilities for design; examining the ways intelligence is seen and enacted gives rise to a very different way of thinking about the intersection between human and machine, and thus promotes some radically new types of interactions with computing machines.",

In this paper we present results from a controlled study with over 200 participants in which the effectiveness of different types of explanations was examined. Participants were shown examples of a system's operation along with various automatically generated explanations, and then tested on their understanding of the system. We show, for example, that explanations describing why the system behaved a certain way resulted in better understanding and stronger feelings of trust. Explanations describing why the system did not behave a certain way, resulted in lower understanding yet adequate performance.

This reduced awareness results in impoverished coordination; for example, the number of conflicts might increase since users are more likely to interact with objects that another person is planning to use. Conflicts may also arise because indirect techniques reduce territorial behavior, expanding the interaction space of each collaborator. In this paper, we introduce three new tabletop coordination techniques designed to reduce conflicts arising from indirect input, while still allowing users the flexibility of distant object control. Two techniques were designed to promote territoriality and to allow users to protect objects when they work near their personal areas, and the third technique lets users set their protection levels dynamically. We present the results of an evaluation, which shows that people prefer techniques that automatically provide protection for personal territories, and that these techniques also increase territorial behavior.",

We found no differences between remote and co-located interfaces in their ability to afford individual and group work.

While the system can support large groups of children, it is unclear how children's performance is affected as group size increases. We explore this question via a study involving two tasks, with children working in group sizes ranging from 1 to 32. The first required reciprocal selection of two on-screen targets, resembling a swarm pointing scenario that might be used in educational applications. The second, a more temporally and spatially distributed pointing task, had children entering different words by selecting characters on an on-screen keyboard. Results indicate that performance is significantly affected by group size only when targets are small. Further, group size had a smaller effect when pointing was spatially and temporally distributed than when everyone was concurrently aiming at the same targets.",

        "abstract": "At first blush, mobile media may appear a promising solution to the problem arising from the fact that parents in the present-day kindergarten institution rely almost solely on teachers' retrospective reports on their child's daily activities. However, a kindergarten is a delicate social fabric that mixes professional roles (the teachers') with socio-emotional relationships (parenting and caring) and involves stakeholders who are dependent on adults in the use of technology (the children). To date, no studies have been reported that critically examine the boundary conditions for successful mobile media applications in such settings. We present a study of Meaning, a one-button capture-and-push-to-Web solution that was used by a Finnish kindergarten for a month. Interviews and the amount of media sent suggest that the intervention was a success, and we report on seven uses of media. However, all uses were critically affected by the users' social fabric, in which the teachers were the nexus. We conclude by discussing various ways in which the heterogeneity of the user group affected mobile media use.",

        "abstract": "One of the major challenges of video game design is to have appropriate difficulty levels for users in order to maximize the entertainment value of the game. Game players may lose interests if a game is either too easy or too difficult. This paper presents a novel methodology to improve user's experience in computer games by automatically adjusting the level of the game difficulty. The difficulty level is computed from measurements of the facial physiology of the players at a distance. The measurements are based on the assumption that the players' performance during the game-playing session alters blood flow in the supraorbital region, which is an indirect measurement of increased mental activities. This alters heat dissipation, which can be monitored in a contact-free manner through a thermal imaging-based stress monitoring and analysis system, known as StressCam. In this work, we investigated on two primary objectives: (1) the feasibility of utilizing the facial physiology in automatically adjusting the difficulty level of the game and (2) the capability of the automatic difficulty level adjustment in improving game players' experience. We employed and extended a XNA video game for this study, and performed an in-depth, comparative usability evaluation on it. Our results show that the automatic difficulty adjustable system successfully maintains game players' interests and substantially outperforms traditional fixed-difficulty mode games. Although a number of issues of this preliminary study remain to be investigated further, this research opens a new direction that utilizes non-contact stress measurements for monitoring and further enhancing a variety of user-centric, interactive entertainment activities.",

These themes provide a set of sensitivities or orientations that may complement traditional task-based approaches to evaluation as well as the more open-ended ones we describe here. Our system showed symptoms of failure under each of these themes. We examine the reasons for this at three levels: problems particular to the specific design hypothesis; problems relevant for input-output mapping more generally; and problems in the design process we used. We conclude by noting that, although interpretive systems such as the one we describe here may succeed in a myriad of different ways, it is reassuring to know that they can also fail, and fail incontrovertibly, yet instructively.",

Although very abstract, these meta-principles generate critical insights into existing HCI approaches, identifying gaps in suitability and coverage. Practical value is increased by progressive instantiation of meta-principles to create first craft-specific, and ultimately project-specific, Interaction Design principles. A worth-centred approach is adopted to illustrate progressive instantiation towards a framework of adapted and novel HCI approaches.

An initial study informed the design of our tactile patterns, and determined appropriate locations for feedback on the body. A second experiment showed that users perceived and correctly classified our tactile instruction patterns in a relaxed setting and during a cognitively and physically demanding task. In a final experiment, snowboarders on the slope compared their perception of tactile instructions with audio instructions under real-world conditions. Tactile instructions achieved overall high recognition accuracy similar to audio instructions. Moreover, participants responded quicker to instructions delivered over the tactile channel than to instructions presented over the audio channel. Our findings suggest that these full-body tactile feedback patterns can replace audio instructions during physical activities.",

In this note, we present an experiment into the use of vibration to alert the user when word completion is likely to aid them, using a dynamic approach based on their current typing speed, and when there are no dictionary matches to their entry. Results show significantly faster entry rates for users with vibration alerts, raising speeds from 20wpm to 23wpm once practiced.",

GestureBar's simple design is also general enough for use with any recognition technique and for integration with standard, non-gestural UI components. We evaluate GestureBar in a formal experiment showing that users can perform complex, ecologically valid tasks in a purely gestural system without training, introduction, or prior gesture experience when using GestureBar, discovering and learning a high percentage of the gestures needed to perform the tasks optimally, and significantly outperforming a state of the art crib sheet.

With the same amount of practice, users could successfully recall more shortcuts and make fewer errors with stroke shortcuts than with keyboard shortcuts. The second half of the paper focuses on UI development support and articulates guidelines for toolkits to implement stroke shortcuts in a wide range of software applications.

To investigate this, we developed five additional directed-edge representations using combinations of shape and color. We performed a user study in which subjects performed different tasks on a collection of graphs using these representations and combinations thereof to investigate which representation is best in terms of speed and accuracy.

We compare the performance of these techniques in both an adjacency exploration task and a node revisiting task.

'Empty moments' provide a compelling new opportunity for design, requiring subtlety and flexibility to enable participants to share connection without explicit messages. We designed MissU as a technology probe to study empty moments in situ. Similar to a private radio station, MissU shares music and background sounds. Field studies produced results relevant to social science, technology and design: couples with established routines were comforted; characteristics such as ambiguity and 'movable' technology (situated in the home yet portable) provide support.
