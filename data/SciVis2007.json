    "abstract": "We present a powerful framework for 3D-texture-based rendering of multiple arbitrarily intersecting volumetric datasets. Each volume is represented by a multi-resolution octree-based structure and we use out-of-core techniques to support extremely large volumes. Users define a set of convex polyhedral volume lenses, which may be associated with one or more volumetric datasets. The volumes or the lenses can be interactively moved around while the region inside each lens is rendered using interactively defined multi-volume shaders. Our rendering pipeline splits each lens into multiple convex regions such that each region is homogenous and contains a fixed number of volumes. Each such region is further split by the brick boundaries of the associated octree representations. The resulting puzzle of lens fragments is sorted in front-to-back or back-to-front order using a combination of a view-dependent octree traversal and a GPU-based depth peeling technique. Our current implementation uses slice-based volume rendering and allows interactive roaming through multiple intersecting multi-gigabyte volumes.",

Based on this framework, we derive algorithms that can robustly optimize the visual quality of an arbitrary combination of projectors without manual adjustment. When the projectors are tiled, we show that our framework automatically produces blending maps that outperform state-of-the-art projector blending methods. When all the projectors are superimposed, the framework can produce high-resolution images beyond the Nyquist resolution limits of component projectors. When a combination of tiled and superimposed projectors are deployed, the same framework harnesses the best features of both tiled and superimposed multi-projector projection paradigms. The framework creates for the first time a new unified paradigm that is agnostic to a particular configuration of projectors yet robustly optimizes for the brightness, contrast, and resolution of that configuration. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithms support high resolution video at real-time interactive frame rates achieved on commodity graphics platforms. This work allows for inexpensive, compelling, flexible, and robust large scale visualization systems to be built and deployed very efficiently.",

The existing feature lines (e.g., ridges, valleys, silhouettes, suggestive contours, etc.) are solely determined by local geometry properties (e.g., normals and curvatures) as well as the view position. This paper is strongly inspired by the observation in human vision and perception that a sudden change in the luminance plays a critical role to faithfully represent and recover the 3D information. In particular, we adopt the edge detection techniques in image processing for 3D shape visualization and present photic extremum lines (PELs) which emphasize significant variations of illumination over 3D surfaces. Comparing with the existing feature lines, PELs are more flexible and offer users more freedom to achieve desirable visualization effects. In addition, the user can easily control the shape visualization by changing the light position, the number of light sources, and choosing various light models. We compare PELs with the existing approaches and demonstrate that PEL is a flexible and effective tool to illustrate 3D surface and volume for visual computing.",

The method employs a fast convection algorithm to attract the evolving surface towards the data points. The force field in which the surface is convected is based on generalized Coulomb potentials evaluated on an adaptive grid (i.e., an octree) using a fast, hierarchical algorithm. Formulating reconstruction as a convection problem in a velocity field generated by Coulomb potentials offers a number of advantages. Unlike methods which compute the distance from the data set to the implicit surface, which are sensitive to noise due to the very reliance on the distance transform, our method is highly resilient to shot noise since global, generalized Coulomb potentials can be used to disregard the presence of outliers due to noise. Coulomb potentials represent long-range interactions that consider all data points at once, and thus they convey global information which is crucial in the fitting process. Both the spatial and temporal complexities of our spatially-adaptive method are proportional to the size of the reconstructed object, which makes our method compare favorably with respect to previous approaches in terms of speed and flexibility. Experiments with sparse as well as noisy data sets show that the method is capable of delivering crisp and detailed yet smooth surfaces.",

The Lagrangian coherent structures are extracted as ridges in finite Lyapunov exponent fields computed from these grids of trajectories. The method is applied to several variants of finite Lyapunov exponents, one of which is newly introduced. High computation time due to the high number of required trajectories is a main drawback when computing Lyapunov exponents of 3-dimensional vector fields. The presented method allows a substantial speed-up by avoiding the seeding of trajectories in regions where no ridges are present or do not satisfy the prescribed filter criteria such as a minimum finite Lyapunov exponent.",

Precise preoperative planning of these procedures, however, is necessary to achieve an optimal therapeutic effect. Therefore, multiple radiological imaging modalities are used prior to surgery to delineate the patient's anatomy, neurological function, and metabolic processes. Developing a three-dimensional perception of the surgical approach, however, is traditionally still done by mentally fusing multiple modalities. Concurrent 3D visualization of these datasets can, therefore, improve the planning process significantly. In this paper we introduce an application for planning of individual neurosurgical approaches with high-quality interactive multimodal volume rendering. The application consists of three main modules which allow to (1) plan the optimal skin incision and opening of the skull tailored to the underlying pathology; (2) visualize superficial brain anatomy, function and metabolism; and (3) plan the patient-specific approach for surgery of deep-seated lesions. The visualization is based on direct multi-volume raycasting on graphics hardware, where multiple volumes from different modalities can be displayed concurrently at interactive frame rates. Graphics memory limitations are avoided by performing raycasting on bricked volumes. For preprocessing tasks such as registration or segmentation, the visualization modules are integrated into a larger framework, thus supporting the entire workflow of preoperative planning.",

Recently, significant emphasis has been placed on focus+context (F+C) techniques (e.g., fisheye views and magnification lens) for data exploration in addition to viewing transformation and hierarchical navigation. However, most of the existing data exploration techniques rely on the manipulation of viewing attributes of the rendering system or optical attributes of the data objects, with users being passive viewers. In this paper, we propose a more active approach to data exploration, which attempts to mimic how we would explore data if we were able to hold it and interact with it in our hands. This involves allowing the users to physically or actively manipulate the geometry of a data object. While this approach has been traditionally used in applications, such as surgical simulation, where the original geometry of the data objects is well understood by the users, there are several challenges when this approach is generalized for applications, such as flow and information visualization, where there is no common perception as to the normal or natural geometry of a data object. We introduce a taxonomy and a set of transformations especially for illustrative deformation of general data exploration.

These data bear a great potential in medical diagnosis, since diseases can be better distinguished and detected at an earlier stage compared to static image data. The wide-spread use of perfusion data is hampered by the lack of efficient evaluation methods. For each voxel, a time-intensity curve characterizes the enhancement of a contrast agent. Parameters derived from these curves characterize the perfusion and have to be integrated for diagnosis. The diagnostic evaluation of this multi-field data is challenging and time-consuming due to its complexity. For the visual analysis of such datasets, feature-based approaches allow to reduce the amount of data and direct the user to suspicious areas. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of perfusion data. For this purpose, we integrate statistical methods and interactive feature specification. Correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied for dimension reduction and to achieve a better understanding of the inter-parameter relations. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions.

Unfortunately, the impulse response measured at a single point does not provide any information about the direction of reflections, and about the reflection surfaces which contribute to this measure.

We use the phonon tracing method to calculate the contribution of the reflection surfaces to the impulse response for different listener positions.

    "abstract": "With the exponential growth in size of geometric data, it is becoming increasingly important to make effective use of multilevel caches, limited disk storage, and bandwidth. As a result, recent work in the visualization community has focused either on designing sequential access compression schemes or on producing cache-coherent layouts of (uncompressed) meshes for random access. Unfortunately combining these two strategies is challenging as they fundamentally assume conflicting modes of data access. In this paper, we propose a novel order-preserving compression method that supports transparent random access to compressed triangle meshes. Our decompression method selectively fetches from disk, decodes, and caches in memory requested parts of a mesh. We also provide a general mesh access API for seamless mesh traversal and incidence queries. While the method imposes no particular mesh layout, it is especially suitable for cache-oblivious layouts, which minimize the number of decompression I/O requests and provide high cache utilization during access to decompressed, in-memory portions of the mesh. Moreover, the transparency of our scheme enables improved performance without the need for application code changes. We achieve compression rates on the order of 20:1 and significantly improved I/O performance due to reduced data transfer. To demonstrate the benefits of our method, we implement two common applications as benchmarks. By using cache-oblivious layouts for the input models, we observe 2-6 times overall speedup compared to using uncompressed meshes.",

    "abstract": "Multi-projector displays today are automatically registered, both geometrically and photometrically, using cameras. Existing registration techniques assume pre-calibrated projectors and cameras that are devoid of imperfections such as lens distortion. In practice, however, these devices are usually imperfect and uncalibrated. Registration of each of these devices is often more challenging than the multi-projector display registration itself. To make tiled projection-based displays accessible to a layman user we should allow the use of uncalibrated inexpensive devices that are prone to imperfections. In this paper, we make two important advances in this direction. First, we present a new geometric registration technique that can achieve geometric alignment in the presence of severe projector lens distortion using a relatively inexpensive low-resolution camera. This is achieved via a closed-form model that relates the projectors to cameras, in planar multi-projector displays, using rational Bezier patches. This enables us to geometrically calibrate a 3000 times 2500 resolution planar multi-projector display made of 3 times 3 array of nine severely distorted projectors using a low resolution (640 times 480) VGA camera. Second, we present a photometric self-calibration technique for a projector-camera pair. This allows us to photometrically calibrate the same display made of nine projectors using a photometrically uncalibrated camera. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that allows geometrically imperfect projectors and photometrically uncalibrated cameras in calibrating multi-projector displays.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a scalable framework for real-time raycasting of large unstructured volumes that employs a hybrid bricking approach. It adaptively combines original unstructured bricks in important (focus) regions, with structured bricks that are resampled on demand in less important (context) regions. The basis of this focus+context approach is interactive specification of a scalar degree of interest (DOI) function. Thus, rendering always considers two volumes simultaneously: a scalar data volume, and the current DOI volume. The crucial problem of visibility sorting is solved by raycasting individual bricks and compositing in visibility order from front to back. In order to minimize visual errors at the grid boundary, it is always rendered accurately, even for resampled bricks. A variety of different rendering modes can be combined, including contour enhancement. A very important property of our approach is that it supports a variety of cell types natively, i.e., it is not constrained to tetrahedral grids, even when interpolation within cells is used. Moreover, our framework can handle multi-variate data, e.g., multiple scalar channels such as temperature or pressure, as well as time-dependent data. The combination of unstructured and structured bricks with different quality characteristics such as the type of interpolation or resampling resolution in conjunction with custom texture memory management yields a very scalable system.",

In the case of multiple volumetric attributes and multiple visual styles the specification of the multi-dimensional transfer function becomes more challenging and non-intuitive. We present a novel methodology for the specification of a mapping from several volumetric attributes to multiple illustrative visual styles. We introduce semantic layers that allow a domain expert to specify the mapping in the natural language of the domain. A semantic layer defines the mapping of volumetric attributes to one visual style. Volumetric attributes and visual styles are represented as fuzzy sets. The mapping is specified by rules that are evaluated with fuzzy logic arithmetics. The user specifies the fuzzy sets and the rules without special knowledge about the underlying rendering technique.

In particular, by taking advantage of physically reactive 3D shadow-space controllers, we can transform the task of interacting with 4D objects to a new level of physical reality. We begin with a teaching tool that uses 2D knot diagrams to manipulate the geometry of 3D mathematical knots via their projections; our unique 2D haptic interface allows the user to become familiar with sketching, editing, exploration, and manipulation of 3D knots rendered as projected images on a 2D shadow space.

However, the former generally includes many redundant streamlines, and the latter requires Boolean decisions on which points are features (and may thus suffer from robustness problems for real-world data). We take a new approach to adaptive streamline placement for steady vector fields in 2D and 3D. We define a metric for local similarity among streamlines and use this metric to grow streamlines from a dense set of candidate seed points. The metric considers not only Euclidean distance, but also a simple statistical measure of shape and directional similarity. Without explicit feature detection, our method produces streamlines that naturally accentuate regions of geometric interest. In conjunction with this method, we also propose a quantitative error metric for evaluating a streamline representation based on how well it preserves the information from the original vector field. This error metric reconstructs a vector field from points on the streamline representation and computes a difference of the reconstruction from the original vector field.",

The application scenario is metrology and dimensional measurement in industrial high resolution 3D X-ray computed tomography (3DCT). Based on the dual source / dual exposure technology this method employs 3DCT scans of a high precision micro-focus and a high energy macro-focus X-ray source. The presented work makes use of the advantages of dual X-ray exposure technology in order to facilitate dimensional measurements of multi-material components with high density material within low density material. We propose a workflow which uses image fusion and local surface extraction techniques: a prefiltering step reduces noise inherent in the data. For image fusion the datasets have to be registered. In the fusion step the benefits of both scans are combined. The structure of the specimen is taken from the low precision, blurry, high energy dataset while the sharp edges are adopted and fused into the resulting image from the high precision, crisp, low energy dataset. In the final step a reliable surface model is extracted from the fused dataset using a local adaptive technique. The major contribution of this paper is the development of a specific workflow for dimensional measurements of multi-material industrial components, which takes two X-ray CT datasets with complementary strengths and weaknesses into account.

In addition to allowing developers and users to freely combine algorithms, visualization pipelines have proven to work well when streaming data and scale well on parallel distributed- memory computers. However, current pipeline visualization frameworks have a critical flaw: they are unable to manage time varying data. As data flows through the pipeline, each algorithm has access to only a single snapshot in time of the data. This prevents the implementation of algorithms that do any temporal processing such as particle tracing; plotting over time; or interpolation, fitting, or smoothing of time series data. As data acquisition technology improves, as simulation time-integration techniques become more complex, and as simulations save less frequently and regularly, the ability to analyze the time-behavior of data becomes more important. This paper describes a modification to the traditional pipeline architecture that allows it to accommodate temporal algorithms. Furthermore, the architecture allows temporal algorithms to be used in conjunction with algorithms expecting a single time snapshot, thus simplifying software design and allowing adoption into existing pipeline frameworks. Our architecture also continues to work well in parallel distributed-memory environments.
