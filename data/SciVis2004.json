    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging method that can be used to measure local information about the structure of white matter within the human brain. Combining DTI data with the computational methods of MR tractography, neuroscientists can estimate the locations and sizes of nerve bundles (white matter pathways) that course through the human brain. Neuroscientists have used visualization techniques to better understand tractography data, but they often struggle with the abundance and complexity of the pathways. We describe a novel set of interaction techniques that make it easier to explore and interpret such pathways. Specifically, our application allows neuroscientists to place and interactively manipulate box-shaped regions (or volumes of interest) to selectively display pathways that pass through specific anatomical areas. A simple and flexible query language allows for arbitrary combinations of these queries using Boolean logic operators. Queries can be further restricted by numerical path properties such as length, mean fractional anisotropy, and mean curvature. By precomputing the pathways and their statistical properties, we obtain the speed necessary for interactive question-and-answer sessions with brain researchers. We survey some questions that researchers have been asking about tractography data and show how our system can be used to answer these questions efficiently.",

We present an integrated system that provides interactive denoising, vortex detection, and visualisation of vector data on Cartesian grids. All three major phases are implemented in such a way that the system runs completely on a modern GPU once the vector field is downloaded into graphics memory. The application aspect of our paper is twofold. First, we show how recently presented, prototypical GPU-based algorithms for filtering, numerical computation, and volume rendering can be combined into one productive system by handling all idiosyncrasies of a chosen graphics card. Second, we demonstrate that the significant speedup achieved compared to an optimized software implementation now allows interactive exploration of characteristic structures in turbulent flow fields.",

    "abstract": "We address the texture level-of-detail problem for extremely large surfaces such as terrain during realtime, view-dependent rendering. A novel texture hierarchy is introduced based on 4-8 refinements of raster tiles, in which the texture grids in effect rotate 45 degrees for each level of refinement. This hierarchy provides twice as many levels of detail as conventional quadtree-style refinement schemes such as mipmaps, and thus provides per-pixel view-dependent filtering that is twice as close to the ideal cutoff frequency for an average pixel. Because of this more gradual change in low-pass filtering, and due to the more precise emulation of the ideal cutoff frequency, we find in practice that the transitions between texture levels of detail are not perceptible. This allows rendering systems to avoid the complexity and performance costs of per-pixel blending between texture levels of detail. The 4-8 texturing scheme is integrated into a variant of the real-time optimally adapting meshes (ROAM) algorithm for view-dependent multiresolution mesh generation. Improvements to ROAM included here are: the diamond data structure as a streamlined replacement for the triangle bintree elements, the use of low-pass-filtered geometry patches in place of individual triangles, integration of 4-8 textures, and a simple out-of-core data access mechanism for texture and geometry tiles.",

While these vector data such as electromagnetic fields, fluid flow fields, or particle paths can be represented by lines, the sheer number of the lines overwhelms the memory and computation capability of a high-end PC used for visualization. Further, very dense or intertwined lines, rendered with traditional visualization techniques, can produce unintelligible results with unclear depth relationships between the lines and no sense of global structure. Our approach is to apply a lighting model to the lines and sample them into an anisotropic voxel representation based on spherical harmonics as a preprocessing step. Then we evaluate and render these voxels for a given view using traditional volume rendering. For extremely large line based datasets, conversion to anisotropic voxels reduces the overall storage and rendering for O(n) lines to O(1) with a large constant that is still small enough to allow meaningful visualization of the entire dataset at nearly interactive rates on a single commodity PC.",

With GPU-based volume rendering driving a nonlinear optimization, we estimate the nebula's local emission density as a function of its radial and axial coordinates, and we recover the orientation of the nebula relative to Earth. The optimization refines the nebula model and its orientation by minimizing the differences between the rendered image and the original astronomical image. The resulting model enables realistic 3D visualizations of planetary nebulae, e.g. for educational purposes in planetarium shows.

We demonstrate that it is possible to encode vector field information (orientation and magnitude) into the parameters governing a reaction-diffusion model to form a spot pattern with the correct orientation, size, and density, creating an effective visualization. To encode direction we texture the spots using a light to dark fading texture. We also show that it is possible to use the reaction-diffusion model to visualize an additional scalar value, such as the uncertainty in the orientation of the vector field. An additional benefit of the reaction-diffusion visualization technique arises from its automatic density distribution. This benefit suggests using the technique to augment other vector visualization techniques. We demonstrate this utility by augmenting a LIC visualization with a reaction-diffusion visualization.

This property determines which structures should be readily discernible and which structures are less important. In those image regions, where an object occludes more important structures it is displayed more sparsely than in those areas where no occlusion occurs. Thus the objects of interest are clearly visible. For each object several representations, i.e., levels of sparseness, are specified. The display of an individual object may incorporate different levels of sparseness. The goal is to emphasize important structures and to maximize the information content in the final image.

This is typically accomplished using transfer functions that increase opacity based on a voxel's value and gradient. Lighting also plays a crucial role in illustrating surfaces. In this paper we present a multi-dimensional transfer function method for enhancing surfaces, not through the variation of opacity, but through the modification of surface shading. The technique uses a lighting transfer function that takes into account the distribution of values along a material boundary and features a novel interface for visualizing and specifying these transfer functions. With our method, the user is given a means of visualizing boundaries without modifying opacity, allowing opacity to be used for illustrating the thickness of homogeneous materials through the absorption of light.",

Our method is composed of three stages: in the first stage, the Gauss points of the FEA cells are calculated. The function values, gradients, diffusions, and influence scopes of the Gauss points are computed. By representing the Gauss points as graph vertices and connecting adjacent Gauss points with edges, an adjacency graph is created. The adjacency graph is used to represent the FEA data in the subsequent computation. In the second stage, a hierarchical structure is established upon the adjacency graph. Any two neighboring vertices with similar function values are merged into a new vertex. The similarity is measured by using a user-defined threshold. Consequently, a new adjacency graph is constructed. Then the threshold is increased, and the graph reduction is triggered again to generate another adjacency graph. By repeating the processing, multiple adjacency graphs are computed, and a level of detail (LoD) representation of the FEA data is established. In the third stage, the LoD structure is rendered by using a splatting method. At first, a level of adjacency graph is selected by users. The graph vertices arc sorted based on their visibility orders and projected onto the image plane in back-to-front order. Billboards are used to render the vertices in the projection. The function values, gradients, and influence scopes of the vertices are utilized to decide the colors, opacities, orientations, and shapes of the billboards. The billboards are then modulated with texture maps to generate the footprints of the vertices. Finally, these footprints are composited to produce the volume rendering image.",

Resampling is also an integral procedure in the registration of multimodal datasets, such as CT, PET, and MRI, in the correction of motion artifacts in MRI, and in the alignment of temporal volume sequences in fMRI. It is well known that the quality of the resampling result depends heavily on the quality of the interpolation filter used. However, high-quality filters are rarely employed in practice due to their large spatial extents. We explore a new resampling technique that operates in the frequency-domain where high-quality filtering is feasible. Further, unlike previous methods of this kind, our technique is not limited to integer-ratio scaling factors, but can resample image and volume datasets at any rate. This would usually require the application of slow discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) to return the data to the spatial domain. We studied two methods that successfully avoid these delays: the chirp-z transform and the FFTW package. We also outline techniques to avoid the ringing artifacts that may occur with frequency-domain filtering. Thus, our method can achieve high-quality interpolation at speeds that are usually associated with spatial filters of far lower quality.",

The objective of this research is to estimate the dimensions of lower extremity arteries, imaged by computed tomography (CT).

The vessel is modeled using an elliptical or cylindrical structure with specific dimensions, orientation and blood vessel mean density.

Taking into account the point spread function (PSF) of a CT scanner, a function is modeled with a Gaussian kernel, in order to smooth the vessel boundary in the model. A new strategy for vessel parameter estimation is presented. It stems from vessel model and model parameter optimization by a nonlinear optimization procedure, i.e., the Levenberg-Marquardt technique.

These disadvantages can be avoided and/or alleviated using an implicit flow model. An implicit flow is a scalar field constructed such that any point in the field is associated with a termination surface using an advection operator on the flow. We present two techniques, a slice-based three-dimensional texture mapping and an interval volume segmentation coupled with a tetrahedron projection-based renderer, to render implicit stream flows.

Our formulation employs the total variation of the surface as a roughness measure. The algorithm consists of two steps: a roughness-capturing flow and a roughness-preserving flow. The roughness capturing step attempts to construct a surface for which the original roughness is captured - distance flow is well suited for roughness capturing. Surface reconstruction is enhanced by using a total variation preserving (TVP) scheme for the roughness-preserving flow.

We explore the use of temporal occlusion coherence (TOC) to accelerate visibility culling for time-varying volume rendering. In our algorithm, the opacity of volume blocks is encoded by means of plenoptic opacity functions (POFs). A coherence-based block fusion technique is employed to coalesce time-coherent data blocks over a span of time steps into a single, representative block.

In this research, we evolve the dataflow concept to allow parts of the visualization process to be executed remotely in a secure and seamless manner. We see dataflow at three levels: an abstract specification of the intent of the visualization; a binding of these abstract modules to a specific software system; and then a binding of software to processing and other resources. We develop an XML application capable of describing visualization at the three levels. To complement this, we have implemented an extension to a popular visualization system, IRIS Explorer, which allows modules in a dataflow pipeline to run on a set of grid resources. For computational steering applications, we have developed a library that allows a visualization system front-end to connect to a simulation running remotely on a grid resource. We demonstrate the work in two applications: the dispersion of a pollutant under different wind conditions; and the solution of a challenging numerical problem in elastohydrodynamic lubrication.",

    "abstract": "Vortex breakdowns and flow recirculation are essential phenomena in aeronautics where they appear as a limiting factor in the design of modern aircrafts. Because of the inherent intricacy of these features, standard flow visualization techniques typically yield cluttered depictions. The paper addresses the challenges raised by the visual exploration and validation of two CFD simulations involving vortex breakdown. To permit accurate and insightful visualization we propose a new approach that unfolds the geometry of the breakdown region by letting a plane travel through the structure along a curve. We track the continuous evolution of the associated projected vector field using the theoretical framework of parametric topology. To improve the understanding of the spatial relationship between the resulting curves and lines we use direct volume rendering and multidimensional transfer functions for the display of flow-derived scalar quantities. This enriches the visualization and provides an intuitive context for the extracted topological information. Our results offer clear, synthetic depictions that permit new insight into the structural properties of vortex breakdowns.",

    "abstract": "An important challenge encountered during post-processing of finite element analyses is the visualizing of three-dimensional fields of real-valued second-order tensors. Namely, as finite element meshes become more complex and detailed, evaluation and presentation of the principal stresses becomes correspondingly problematic. In this paper, we describe techniques used to visualize simulations of perturbed in-situ stress fields associated with hypothetical salt bodies in the Gulf of Mexico. We present an adaptation of the Mohr diagram, a graphical paper and pencil method used by the material mechanics community for estimating coordinate transformations for stress tensors, as a new tensor glyph for dynamically exploring tensor variables within three-dimensional finite element models. This interactive glyph can be used as either a probe or a filter through brushing and linking.",

    "abstract": "We present a system for enhancing observation of user interactions in virtual environments. In particular, we focus on analyzing behavior patterns in the popular team-based first-person perspective game Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory. This game belongs to a genre characterized by two moderate-sized teams (usually 6 to 12 players each) competing over a set of objectives. Our system allows spectators to visualize global features such as large-scale behaviors and team strategies, as opposed to the limited, local view that traditional spectating modes provide. We also add overlay visualizations of semantic information related to the action that might be important to a spectator in order to reduce the information overload that plagues traditional overview visualizations. These overlays can visualize information about abstract concepts such as player distribution over time and areas of intense combat activity, and also highlight important features like player paths, fire coverage, etc. This added information allows spectators to identify important game events more easily and reveals large-scale player behaviors that might otherwise be overlooked.",

    "abstract": "Waves are a fundamental mechanism for conveying information in many physical problems. Direct visualization techniques are often used to display wave fronts. However, the information derived from such visualizations may not be as central to an investigation as an understanding of how the location, structure and time course of the wave change as key experimental parameters are varied. In experimental data, these questions are confounded by noise and incomplete data. Recognition of waves in networks of neurons is additionally complicated by the presence of long-range physical connections and recurrent excitation. This work applies visual techniques to analyze the structural details of waves in response data from the turtle visual cortex. We emphasize low-cost visualizations that allow comparisons across neural data sets and variables to reconstruct the choreography for a complex response.",

    "abstract": "The continuing advancement of plasma science is central to realizing fusion as an inexpensive and safe energy source. Gryokinetic simulations of plasmas are fundamental to the understanding of turbulent transport in fusion plasma. This work discusses the visualization challenges presented by gyrokinetic simulations using magnetic field line following coordinates, and presents an effective solution exploiting programmable graphics hardware to enable interactive volume visualization of 3D plasma flow on a toroidal coordinate system. The new visualization capability can help scientists better understand three-dimensional structures of the modeled phenomena. Both the limitations and future promise of the hardware-accelerated approach are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "We propose an interpolating refinement method for two- and three-dimensional scalar fields defined on hexahedral grids. Iterative fairing of the underlying contours (isosurfaces) provides the function values of new grid points. Our method can be considered as a nonlinear variational subdivision scheme for volumes. It can be applied locally for adaptive mesh refinement in regions of high geometric complexity. We use our scheme to increase the quality of low-resolution data sets and to reduce interpolation artifacts in texture-based volume rendering.",

    "abstract": "Vorticity is the quantity used to describe the creation, transformation and extinction of vortices. It is present not only in vortices but also in shear flow. Especially in ducted flows, most of the overall vorticity is usually contained in the boundary layer. When a vortex develops from the boundary layer, this can be described by transport of vorticity. For a better understanding of a flow it is therefore of interest to examine vorticity in all of its different roles. The goal of this application study was not primarily the visualization of vortices but of vorticity distribution and its role in vortex phenomena. The underlying industrial case is a design optimization for a Pelton turbine. An important industrial objective is to improve the quality of the water jets driving the runner. Jet quality is affected mostly by vortices originating in the distributor ring. For a better understanding of this interrelation, it is crucial to not only visualize these vortices but also to analyze the mechanisms of their creation. We used various techniques for the visualization of vorticity, including field lines and modified isosurfaces. For field line based visualization, we extended the image-guided streamline placement algorithm of Turk and Banks to data-guided field line placement on three-dimensional unstructured grids.",
