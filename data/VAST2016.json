    "abstract": "The problem of formulating solutions immediately and comparing them rapidly for billboard placements has plagued advertising planners for a long time, owing to the lack of efficient tools for in-depth analyses to make informed decisions. In this study, we attempt to employ visual analytics that combines the state-of-the-art mining and visualization techniques to tackle this problem using large-scale GPS trajectory data. In particular, we present SmartAdP, an interactive visual analytics system that deals with the two major challenges including finding good solutions in a huge solution space and comparing the solutions in a visual and intuitive manner. An interactive framework that integrates a novel visualization-driven data mining model enables advertising planners to effectively and efficiently formulate good candidate solutions. In addition, we propose a set of coupled visualizations: a solution view with metaphor-based glyphs to visualize the correlation between different solutions; a location view to display billboard locations in a compact manner; and a ranking view to present multi-typed rankings of the solutions. This system has been demonstrated using case studies with a real-world dataset and domain-expert interviews. Our approach can be adapted for other location selection problems such as selecting locations of retail stores or restaurants using trajectory data.",

    "abstract": "Massive taxi trajectory data is exploited for knowledge discovery in transportation and urban planning. Existing tools typically require users to select and brush geospatial regions on a map when retrieving and exploring taxi trajectories and passenger trips. To answer seemingly simple questions such as \"What were the taxi trips starting from Main Street and ending at Wall Street in the morning?\" or \"Where are the taxis arriving at the Art Museum at noon typically coming from?\", tedious and time consuming interactions are usually needed since the numeric GPS points of trajectories are not directly linked to the keywords such as \"Main Street\", \"Wall Street\", and \"Art Museum\". In this paper, we present SemanticTraj, a new method for managing and visualizing taxi trajectory data in an intuitive, semantic rich, and efficient means. With SemanticTraj, domain and public users can find answers to the aforementioned questions easily through direct queries based on the terms. They can also interactively explore the retrieved data in visualizations enhanced by semantic information of the trajectories and trips. In particular, taxi trajectories are converted into taxi documents through a textualization transformation process. This process maps GPS points into a series of street/POI names and pick-up/drop-off locations. It also converts vehicle speeds into user-defined descriptive terms. Then, a corpus of taxi documents is formed and indexed to enable flexible semantic queries over a text search engine. Semantic labels and meta-summaries of the results are integrated with a set of visualizations in a SemanticTraj prototype, which helps users study taxi trajectories quickly and easily. A set of usage scenarios are presented to show the usability of the system. We also collected feedback from domain experts and conducted a preliminary user study to evaluate the visual system.",

    "abstract": "Data analysis involves constantly formulating and testing new hypotheses and questions about data. When dealing with a new dataset, especially one with many dimensions, it can be cumbersome for the analyst to clearly remember which aspects of the data have been investigated (i.e., visually examined for patterns, trends, outliers etc.) and which combinations have not. Yet this information is critical to help the analyst formulate new questions that they have not already answered. We observe that for tabular data, questions are typically comprised of varying combinations of data dimensions (e.g., what are the trends of Sales and Profit for different Regions?). We propose representing analysis history from the angle of dimension coverage (i.e., which data dimensions have been investigated and in which combinations). We use scented widgets [30] to incorporate dimension coverage of the analysts' past work into interaction widgets of a visualization tool. We demonstrate how this approach can assist analysts with the question formation process. Our approach extends the concept of scented widgets to reveal aspects of one's own analysis history, and offers a different perspective on one's past work than typical visualization history tools. Results of our empirical study showed that participants with access to embedded dimension coverage information relied on this information when formulating questions, asked more questions about the data, generated more top-level findings, and showed greater breadth of their analysis without sacrificing depth.",

We introduce Matrix Diagnostics (or Magnostics), following in spirit related approaches for rating and ranking other visualization techniques, such as Scagnostics for scatter plots. Our approach ranks matrix views according to the appearance of specific visual patterns, such as blocks and lines, indicating the existence of topological motifs in the data, such as clusters, bi-graphs, or central nodes. Magnostics can be used to analyze, query, or search for visually similar matrices in large collections, or to assess the quality of matrix reordering algorithms. While many feature descriptors for image analyzes exist, there is no evidence how they perform for detecting patterns in matrices. In order to make an informed choice of feature descriptors for matrix diagnostics, we evaluate 30 feature descriptors-27 existing ones and three new descriptors that we designed specifically for MAGNOSTICS-with respect to four criteria: pattern response, pattern variability, pattern sensibility, and pattern discrimination. We conclude with an informed set of six descriptors as most appropriate for Magnostics and demonstrate their application in two scenarios; exploring a large collection of matrices and analyzing temporal networks.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent popularity of visual analytics focusing on big data, little is known about how to support users that use visualization techniques to explore multi-dimensional datasets and accomplish specific tasks. Our lack of models that can assist end-users during the data exploration process has made it challenging to learn from the user's interactive and analytical process. The ability to model how a user interacts with a specific visualization technique and what difficulties they face are paramount in supporting individuals with discovering new patterns within their complex datasets. This paper introduces the notion of visualization systems understanding and modeling user interactions with the intent of guiding a user through a task thereby enhancing visual data exploration. The challenges faced and the necessary future steps to take are discussed; and to provide a working example, a grammar-based model is presented that can learn from user interactions, determine the common patterns among a number of subjects using a K-Reversible algorithm, build a set of rules, and apply those rules in the form of suggestions to new users with the goal of guiding them along their visual analytic process. A formal evaluation study with 300 subjects was performed showing that our grammar-based model is effective at capturing the interactive process followed by users and that further research in this area has the potential to positively impact how users interact with a visualization system.",

    "abstract": "Oftentimes multivariate data are not available as sets of equally multivariate tuples, but only as sets of projections into subspaces spanned by subsets of these attributes. For example, one may find data with five attributes stored in six tables of two attributes each, instead of a single table of five attributes. This prohibits the visualization of these data with standard high-dimensional methods, such as parallel coordinates or MDS, and there is hence the need to reconstruct the full multivariate (joint) distribution from these marginal ones. Most of the existing methods designed for this purpose use an iterative procedure to estimate the joint distribution. With insufficient marginal distributions and domain knowledge, they lead to results whose joint errors can be large. Moreover, enforcing smoothness for regularizations in the joint space is not applicable if the attributes are not numerical but categorical. We propose a visual analytics approach that integrates both anecdotal data and human experts to iteratively narrow down a large set of plausible solutions. The solution space is populated using a Monte Carlo procedure which uniformly samples the solution space. A level-of-detail high dimensional visualization system helps the user understand the patterns and the uncertainties. Constraints that narrow the solution space can then be added by the user interactively during the iterative exploration, and eventually a subset of solutions with narrow uncertainty intervals emerges.",

    "abstract": "We present a design space exploration of interaction techniques for supporting multiple collaborators exploring data on a shared large display. Our proposed solution is based on users controlling individual lenses using both explicit gestures as well as proxemics: the spatial relations between people and physical artifacts such as their distance, orientation, and movement. We discuss different design considerations for implicit and explicit interactions through the lens, and evaluate the user experience to find a balance between the implicit and explicit interaction styles. Our findings indicate that users favor implicit interaction through proxemics for navigation and collaboration, but prefer using explicit mid-air gestures to perform actions that are perceived to be direct, such as terminating a lens composition. Based on these results, we propose a hybrid technique utilizing both proxemics and mid-air gestures, along with examples applying this technique to other datasets. Finally, we performed a usability evaluation of the hybrid technique and observed user performance improvements in the presence of both implicit and explicit interaction styles.",

The outputs of simulations are multi-resolution spatial temporal ensembles. Each simulation run uses a unique set of values for multiple convective parameters. Distinct parameter settings from different simulation runs in different resolutions constitute a multi-resolution high-dimensional parameter space. Understanding the correlation between the different convective parameters, and establishing a connection between the parameter settings and the ensemble outputs are crucial to domain scientists. The multi-resolution high-dimensional parameter space, however, presents a unique challenge to the existing correlation visualization techniques. We present Nested Parallel Coordinates Plot (NPCP), a new type of parallel coordinates plots that enables visualization of intra-resolution and inter-resolution parameter correlations. With flexible user control, NPCP integrates superimposition, juxtaposition and explicit encodings in a single view for comparative data visualization and analysis. We develop an integrated visual analytics system to help domain scientists understand the connection between multi-resolution convective parameters and the large spatial temporal ensembles.

In this paper, we present a visual analytics approach for better understanding, diagnosing, and refining deep CNNs. We formulate a deep CNN as a directed acyclic graph. Based on this formulation, a hybrid visualization is developed to disclose the multiple facets of each neuron and the interactions between them. In particular, we introduce a hierarchical rectangle packing algorithm and a matrix reordering algorithm to show the derived features of a neuron cluster.

Artificial neural networks currently achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. Although such networks are typically used as black-boxes, they are also widely believed to learn (high-dimensional) higher-level representations of the original observations. In this paper, we propose using dimensionality reduction for two tasks: visualizing the relationships between learned representations of observations, and visualizing the relationships between artificial neurons. Through experiments conducted in three traditional image classification benchmark datasets, we show how visualization can provide highly valuable feedback for network designers. For instance, our discoveries in one of these datasets (SVHN) include the presence of interpretable clusters of learned representations, and the partitioning of artificial neurons into groups with apparently related discriminative roles.",

Our system estimates all possible allocations, and then provides visual cues to users to help them validate every ambiguous case. By looping users in the disambiguation process, our system can achieve more reliable results than general data mining models for highly ambiguous cases. In addition, once an ambiguous case is resolved, the result is instantly added back to our system and serves as additional cues for all the remaining unidentified names. In this way, we open up the black box in traditional disambiguation processes, and help intuitively and comprehensively explain why the corresponding classifications should hold.

However, due to its significant processing time and non-interactive nature, topic modeling has so far not been tightly integrated into a visual analytics workflow. Instead, most such systems are limited to utilizing a fixed, initial set of topics. Motivated by this gap in the literature, we propose a novel interaction technique called TopicLens that allows a user to dynamically explore data through a lens interface where topic modeling and the corresponding 2D embedding are efficiently computed on the fly. To support this interaction in real time while maintaining view consistency, we propose a novel efficient topic modeling method and a semi-supervised 2D embedding algorithm. Our work is based on improving state-of-the-art methods such as nonnegative matrix factorization and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Furthermore, we have built a web-based visual analytics system integrated with TopicLens. We use this system to measure the performance and the visualization quality of our proposed methods.

    "abstract": "The creation of interactive visualization to analyze text documents has gained an impressive momentum in recent years. This is not surprising in the light of massive and still increasing amounts of available digitized texts. Websites, social media, news wire, and digital libraries are just few examples of the diverse text sources whose visual analysis and exploration offers new opportunities to effectively mine and manage the information and knowledge hidden within them. A popular visualization method for large text collections is to represent each document by a glyph in 2D space. These landscapes can be the result of optimizing pairwise distances in 2D to represent document similarities, or they are provided directly as meta data, such as geo-locations. For well-defined information needs, suitable interaction methods are available for these spatializations. However, free exploration and navigation on a level of abstraction between a labeled document spatialization and reading single documents is largely unsupported. As a result, vital foraging steps for task-tailored actions, such as selecting subgroups of documents for detailed inspection, or subsequent sense-making steps are hampered. To fill in this gap, we propose DocuCompass, a focus+context approach based on the lens metaphor. It comprises multiple methods to characterize local groups of documents, and to efficiently guide exploration based on users' requirements. DocuCompass thus allows for effective interactive exploration of document landscapes without disrupting the mental map of users by changing the layout itself. We discuss the suitability of multiple navigation and characterization methods for different spatializations and texts. Finally, we provide insights generated through user feedback and discuss the effectiveness of our approach.",

Unfortunately, there is a natural correlation between the complexity of the data and the complexity of the tools to study them. An adverse effect of complicated tools is that analytical goals are more difficult to reach. Therefore, it makes sense to consider methods that guide or assist users in the visual analysis process. Several such methods already exist in the literature, yet we are lacking a general model that facilitates in-depth reasoning about guidance. We establish such a model by extending van Wijk's model of visualization with the fundamental components of guidance. Guidance is defined as a process that gradually narrows the gap that hinders effective continuation of the data analysis. We describe diverse inputs based on which guidance can be generated and discuss different degrees of guidance and means to incorporate guidance into VA tools. We use existing guidance approaches from the literature to illustrate the various aspects of our model. As a conclusion, we identify research challenges and suggest directions for future studies.

This approach has enabled some important comparisons between systems, but unfortunately the narrow scope required to facilitate these comparisons has prevented many of these lessons from being generalized to new areas. At the same time, advanced visual analytic systems have made increasing use of human-machine collaboration to solve problems not tractable by machine computation alone. To continue to make progress in modeling user tasks in these hybrid visual analytic systems, we must strive to gain insight into what makes certain tasks more complex than others. This will require the development of mechanisms for describing the balance to be struck between machine and human strengths with respect to analytical tasks and workload. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of theoretical tools for reasoning about such balance in visual analytic systems and demonstrate the utility of the Human Oracle Model for this purpose in the context of sensemaking in visual analytics. Additionally, we make use of the Human Oracle Model to guide the development of a new system through a case study in the domain of cybersecurity.",

It is of paramount importance that this dialogue is not interrupted by slow computational mechanisms that do not consider any known temporal human-computer interaction characteristics that prioritize the perceptual and cognitive capabilities of the users. In cases where the analysis involves an integrated computational method, for instance to reduce the dimensionality of the data or to perform clustering, such non-optimal processes are often likely. To remedy this, progressive computations, where results are iteratively improved, are getting increasing interest in visual analytics.

We define methodologies to facilitate processes that adhere to the perceptual characteristics of users and describe how online algorithms can be incorporated within these.

Crowdsourcing medical applications have recently shown promise where the non-expert users (the crowd) were able to achieve accuracy similar to the medical experts. This has the potential to reduce interpretation/reading time and possibly improve accuracy by building a consensus on the findings beforehand and letting the medical experts make the final diagnosis. In this paper, we focus on a virtual colonoscopy (VC) application with the clinical technicians as our target users, and the radiologists acting as consultants and classifying segments as benign or malignant. In particular, C2A is used to analyze and explore crowd responses on video segments, created from fly-throughs in the virtual colon. C2A provides several interactive visualization components to build crowd consensus on video segments, to detect anomalies in the crowd data and in the VC video segments, and finally, to improve the non-expert user's work quality and performance by A/B testing for the optimal crowdsourcing platform and application-specific parameters. Case studies and domain experts feedback demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving workers' output quality, the potential to reduce the radiologists' interpretation time, and hence, the potential to improve the traditional clinical workflow by marking the majority of the video segments as benign based on the crowd consensus.",

EventAction provides a visual analytics approach to (1) identify similar records, (2) explore potential outcomes, (3) review recommended temporal event sequences that might help achieve the users' goals, and (4) interactively assist users as they define a personalized action plan associated with a probability of success. Following the design study framework, we designed and deployed EventAction in the context of student advising and reported on the evaluation with a student review manager and three graduate students.",

    "abstract": "Public perceptions of a brand is critical to its performance. While social media has demonstrated a huge potential to shape public perceptions of brands, existing tools are not intuitive and explanatory for domain users to use as they fail to provide a comprehensive analysis framework for perceptions of brands. In this paper, we present SocialBrands, a novel visual analysis tool for brand managers to understand public perceptions of brands on social media. Social-Brands leverages brand personality framework in marketing literature and social computing approaches to compute the personality of brands from three driving factors (user imagery, employee imagery, and official announcement) on social media, and construct an evidence network explaining the association between brand personality and driving factors. These computational results are then integrated with new interactive visualizations to help brand managers understand personality traits and their driving factors. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of SocialBrands through a series of user studies with brand managers in an enterprise context. Design lessons are also derived from our studies.",

    "abstract": "Visual analytics techniques help users explore high-dimensional data. However, it is often challenging for users to express their domain knowledge in order to steer the underlying data model, especially when they have little attribute-level knowledge. Furthermore, users' complex, high-level domain knowledge, compared to low-level attributes, posits even greater challenges. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a technique to interpret a user's drawings with an interactive, nonlinear axis mapping approach called AxiSketcher. This technique enables users to impose their domain knowledge on a visualization by allowing interaction with data entries rather than with data attributes. The proposed interaction is performed through directly sketching lines over the visualization. Using this technique, users can draw lines over selected data points, and the system forms the axes that represent a nonlinear, weighted combination of multidimensional attributes. In this paper, we describe our techniques in three areas: 1) the design space of sketching methods for eliciting users' nonlinear domain knowledge; 2) the underlying model that translates users' input, extracts patterns behind the selected data points, and results in nonlinear axes reflecting users' complex intent; and 3) the interactive visualization for viewing, assessing, and reconstructing the newly formed, nonlinear axes.",

    "abstract": "Centralized matching is a ubiquitous resource allocation problem. In a centralized matching problem, each agent has a preference list ranking the other agents and a central planner is responsible for matching the agents manually or with an algorithm. While algorithms can find a matching which optimizes some performance metrics, they are used as a black box and preclude the central planner from applying his domain knowledge to find a matching which aligns better with the user tasks. Furthermore, the existing matching visualization techniques (i.e. bipartite graph and adjacency matrix) fail in helping the central planner understand the differences between matchings. In this paper, we present VisMatchmaker, a visualization system which allows the central planner to explore alternatives to an algorithm-generated matching. We identified three common tasks in the process of matching adjustment: problem detection, matching recommendation and matching evaluation. We classified matching comparison into three levels and designed visualization techniques for them, including the number line view and the stacked graph view. Two types of algorithmic support, namely direct assignment and range search, and their interactive operations are also provided to enable the user to apply his domain knowledge in matching adjustment.",

For DR techniques to be useful in exploratory data analysis, they need to be adapted to human needs and domain-specific problems, ideally, interactively, and on-the-fly. Many visual analytics systems have already demonstrated the benefits of tightly integrating DR with interactive visualizations. Nevertheless, a general, structured understanding of this integration is missing. To address this, we systematically studied the visual analytics and visualization literature to investigate how analysts interact with automatic DR techniques. The results reveal seven common interaction scenarios that are amenable to interactive control such as specifying algorithmic constraints, selecting relevant features, or choosing among several DR algorithms. We investigate specific implementations of visual analysis systems integrating DR, and analyze ways that other machine learning methods have been combined with DR. Summarizing the results in a \"human in the loop\" process model provides a general lens for the evaluation of visual interactive DR systems. We apply the proposed model to study and classify several systems previously described in the literature, and to derive future research opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Data flow systems allow the user to design a flow diagram that specifies the relations between system components which process, filter or visually present the data. Visualization systems may benefit from user-defined data flows as an analysis typically consists of rendering multiple plots on demand and performing different types of interactive queries across coordinated views. In this paper, we propose VisFlow, a web-based visualization framework for tabular data that employs a specific type of data flow model called the subset flow model. VisFlow focuses on interactive queries within the data flow, overcoming the limitation of interactivity from past computational data flow systems. In particular, VisFlow applies embedded visualizations and supports interactive selections, brushing and linking within a visualization-oriented data flow. The model requires all data transmitted by the flow to be a data item subset (i.e. groups of table rows) of some original input table, so that rendering properties can be assigned to the subset unambiguously for tracking and comparison. VisFlow features the analysis flexibility of a flow diagram, and at the same time reduces the diagram complexity and improves usability. We demonstrate the capability of VisFlow on two case studies with domain experts on real-world datasets showing that VisFlow is capable of accomplishing a considerable set of visualization and analysis tasks.

In this paper we address the workload challenge with a data structuring and exploration scheme that affords dimension relation detection and that serves as the background knowledge for further investigation. We contribute a novel data structuring scheme that leverages an information-theoretic view structuring algorithm to uncover information-aware relations among different data views, and thereby discloses redundancy and other relation patterns among dimensions.

We present annotation graphs, a dynamic graph visualization that enables meta-analysis of data based on user-authored annotations. The annotation graph topology encodes annotation semantics, which describe the content of and relations between data selections, comments, and tags. We present a mixed-initiative approach to graph layout that integrates an analyst's manual manipulations with an automatic method based on similarity inferred from the annotation semantics. Various visual graph layout styles reveal different perspectives on the annotation semantics. Annotation graphs are implemented within C8, a system that supports authoring annotations during exploratory analysis of a dataset. We apply principles of Exploratory Sequential Data Analysis (ESDA) in designing C8, and further link these to an existing task typology in the visualization literature. We develop and evaluate the system through an iterative user-centered design process with three experts, situated in the domain of analyzing HCI experiment data. The results suggest that annotation graphs are effective as a method of visually extending user-authored annotations to data meta-analysis for discovery and organization of ideas.",

These visual analytic methods are beginning to be instantiated within mixed-initiative systems, where humans and machines collaboratively influence evidence-gathering and decision-making. But an open research question is that, when domain experts analyze their data, can they completely trust the outputs and operations on the machine-side? Visualization potentially leads to a transparent analysis process, but do domain experts always trust what they see? To address these questions, we present results from the design and evaluation of a mixed-initiative, visual analytics system for biologists, focusing on analyzing the relationships between familiarity of an analysis medium and domain experts' trust. We propose a trust-augmented design of the visual analytics system, that explicitly takes into account domain-specific tasks, conventions, and preferences. For evaluating the system, we present the results of a controlled user study with 34 biologists where we compare the variation of the level of trust across conventional and visual analytic mediums and explore the influence of familiarity and task complexity on trust. We find that despite being unfamiliar with a visual analytic medium, scientists seem to have an average level of trust that is comparable with the same in conventional analysis medium. In fact, for complex sense-making tasks, we find that the visual analytic system is able to inspire greater trust than other mediums. We summarize the implications of our findings with directions for future research on trustworthiness of visual analytic systems.",

Advances in solver technologies over recent years have allowed the successful use of constraint programming in many application areas. However, when a particular solver's search for a solution takes too long, the complexity of the constraint program execution hinders the programmer's ability to profile that search and understand how it relates to their model. Therefore, effective tools to support such profiling and allow users of constraint programming technologies to refine their model or experiment with different search parameters are essential. This paper details the first user-centred design process for visual profiling tools in this domain. We report on: our insights and opportunities identified through an on-line questionnaire and a creativity workshop with domain experts carried out to elicit requirements for analytical and visual profiling techniques; our designs and functional prototypes realising such techniques; and case studies demonstrating how these techniques shed light on the behaviour of the solvers in practice.",

    "abstract": "Sensemaking is described as the process in which people collect, organize and create representations of information, all centered around some problem they need to understand. People often get lost when solving complicated tasks using big datasets over long periods of exploration and analysis. They may forget what they have done, are unaware of where they are in the context of the overall task, and are unsure where to continue. In this paper, we introduce a tool, SenseMap, to address these issues in the context of browser-based online sensemaking. We conducted a semi-structured interview with nine participants to explore their behaviors in online sensemaking with existing browser functionality. A simplified sensemaking model based on Pirolli and Card's model is derived to better represent the behaviors we found: users iteratively collect information sources relevant to the task, curate them in a way that makes sense, and finally communicate their findings to others. SenseMap automatically captures provenance of user sensemaking actions and provides multi-linked views to visualize the collected information and enable users to curate and communicate their findings. To explore how SenseMap is used, we conducted a user study in a naturalistic work setting with five participants completing the same sensemaking task related to their daily work activities. All participants found the visual representation and interaction of the tool intuitive to use. Three of them engaged with the tool and produced successful outcomes. It helped them to organize information sources, to quickly find and navigate to the sources they wanted, and to effectively communicate their findings.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present PorosityAnalyzer, a novel tool for detailed evaluation and visual analysis of pore segmentation pipelines to determine the porosity in fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs). The presented tool consists of two modules: the computation module and the analysis module. The computation module enables a convenient setup and execution of distributed off-line-computations on industrial 3D X-ray computed tomography datasets. It allows the user to assemble individual segmentation pipelines in the form of single pipeline steps, and to specify the parameter ranges as well as the sampling of the parameter-space of each pipeline segment. The result of a single segmentation run consists of the input parameters, the calculated 3D binary-segmentation mask, the resulting porosity value, and other derived results (e.g., segmentation pipeline run-time). The analysis module presents the data at different levels of detail by drill-down filtering in order to determine accurate and robust segmentation pipelines. Overview visualizations allow to initially compare and evaluate the segmentation pipelines. With a scatter plot matrix (SPLOM), the segmentation pipelines are examined in more detail based on their input and output parameters. Individual segmentation-pipeline runs are selected in the SPLOM and visually examined and compared in 2D slice views and 3D renderings by using aggregated segmentation masks and statistical contour renderings. PorosityAnalyzer has been thoroughly evaluated with the help of twelve domain experts. Two case studies demonstrate the applicability of our proposed concepts and visualization techniques, and show that our tool helps domain experts to gain new insights and improve their workflow efficiency.",

The annotation and analysis are tightly coupled by multiple linked views that allow for a direct interpretation of the labeled data in the context of the recorded video stimuli.

Gaze pattern comparison is essential to understanding how radiologists examine medical images, and to identifying factors influencing the examination. Most prior work depended upon comparisons with manually juxtaposed static images of gaze tracking results. Comparative gaze analysis with volumetric images is more challenging due to the additional cognitive load on 3D perception. A recent study proposed a visualization design based on direct volume rendering (DVR) for visualizing gaze patterns in volumetric images; however, effective and comprehensive gaze pattern comparison is still challenging due to a lack of interactive visualization tools for comparative gaze analysis. We take the challenge with GazeDx while integrating crucial contextual information such as pupil size and windowing into the analysis process for more in-depth and ecologically valid findings. Among the interactive visualization components in GazeDx, a context-embedded interactive scatterplot is especially designed to help users examine abstract gaze data in diverse contexts by embedding medical imaging representations well known to radiologists in it.

Although predictive models can foresee the dropout behavior, it is still difficult for users to understand the reasons behind the predicted results and further design interventions to prevent dropout. In addition, with a better understanding of dropout, researchers in the area of predictive modeling in turn can improve the models.

Often the analytical task in such data is to identify specific patterns, but this is a very complex and computationally difficult problem and so focusing the search in order to only identify interesting patterns is a common solution. We propose an efficient method for exploring user-sketched patterns, incorporating the domain expert's knowledge, in time series data through a shape grammar based approach. The shape grammar is extracted from the time series by considering the data as a combination of basic elementary shapes positioned across different amplitudes. We represent these basic shapes using a ratio value, perform binning on ratio values and apply a symbolic approximation. Our proposed method for pattern matching is amplitude-, scale- and translation-invariant and, since the pattern search and pattern constraint relaxation happen at the symbolic level, is very efficient permitting its use in a real-time/online system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a case study on stock market data although it is applicable to any numeric time series data.",
